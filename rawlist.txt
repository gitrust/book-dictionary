CHAPTER
UNCLE
MAKES
GREAT
DISCOVERY

Looking
back
all
that
has
occurred
since
that
eventful
day
scarcely
able
believe
the
reality
adventures
They
were
truly
wonderful
that
even
now
bewildered
when
think
them

uncle
was
German
having
married
mother's
sister
Englishwoman
Being
very
much
attached
his
fatherless
nephew
invited
study
under
him
his
home
the
fatherland
This
home
was
large
town
and
uncle
professor
philosophy
chemistry
geology
mineralogy
and
many
other
ologies

One
day
after
passing
some
hours
the
laboratory—my
uncle
being
absent
the
time—I
suddenly
felt
the
necessity
renovating
the
tissues—ie
was
hungry
and
was
about
rouse
our
old
French
cook
when
uncle
Professor
Von
Hardwigg
suddenly
opened
the
street
door
and
came
rushing
upstairs

Now
Professor
Hardwigg
worthy
uncle
means
bad
sort
man
however
choleric
and
original
bear
with
him
means
obey
and
scarcely
had
his
heavy
feet
resounded
within
our
joint
domicile
than
shouted
for
attend
upon
him

Harry—Harry—Harry—

hastened
obey
but
before
could
reach
his
room
jumping
three
steps
time
was
stamping
his
right
foot
upon
the
landing

Harry
cried
frantic
tone
are
you
coming
Now
tell
the
truth
that
moment
was
far
more
interested
the
question
what
was
constitute
our
dinner
than
any
problem
science
soup
was
more
interesting
than
soda
omelette
more
tempting
than
arithmetic
and
artichoke
ten
times
more
value
than
any
amount
asbestos

But
uncle
was
not
man
kept
waiting
adjourning
therefore
all
minor
questions
presented
myself
before
him

was
very
learned
man
Now
most
persons
this
category
supply
themselves
with
information
peddlers
with
goods
for
the
benefit
others
and
lay
stores
order
diffuse
them
abroad
for
the
benefit
society
general
Not
excellent
uncle
Professor
Hardwigg
studied
consumed
the
midnight
oil
pored
over
heavy
tomes
and
digested
huge
quartos
and
folios
order
keep
the
knowledge
acquired
himself

There
was
reason
and
may
regarded
good
one
why
uncle
objected
display
his
learning
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary:
stammered
and
when
intent
upon
explaining
the
phenomena
the
heavens
was
apt
find
himself
fault
and
allude
such
vague
way
sun
moon
and
stars
that
few
were
able
comprehend
his
meaning
tell
the
honest
truth
when
the
right
word
would
not
come
was
generally
replaced
very
powerful
adjective

connection
with
the
sciences
there
are
many
almost
unpronounceable
names—names
very
much
resembling
those
Welsh
villages
and
uncle
being
very
fond
using
them
his
habit
stammering
was
not
thereby
improved
fact
there
were
periods
his
discourse
when
would
finally
give
and
swallow
his
discomfiture—in
glass
water

said
uncle
Professor
Hardwigg
was
very
learned
man
and
now
add
most
kind
relative
was
bound
him
the
double
ties
affection
and
interest
took
deep
interest
all
his
doings
and
hoped
some
day
almost
learned
myself
was
rare
thing
for
absent
from
his
lectures
Like
him
preferred
mineralogy
all
the
other
sciences
anxiety
was
gain
real
knowledge
the
earth
Geology
and
mineralogy
were
the
sole
objects
life
and
connection
with
these
studies
many
fair
specimen
stone
chalk
metal
did
break
with
our
hammers

Steel
rods
loadstones
glass
pipes
and
bottles
various
acids
were
oftener
before
than
our
meals
uncle
Hardwigg
was
once
known
classify
six
hundred
different
geological
specimens
their
weight
hardness
fusibility
sound
taste
and
smell

corresponded
with
all
the
great
learned
and
scientific
men
the
age
was
therefore
constant
communication
with
all
events
the
letters
Sir
Humphry
Davy
Captain
Franklin
and
other
great
men

But
before
state
the
subject
which
uncle
wished
confer
with
must
say
word
about
his
personal
appearance
Alas
readers
will
see
very
different
portrait
him
future
time
after
has
gone
through
the
fearful
adventures
yet
related

uncle
was
fifty
years
old
tall
thin
and
wiry
Large
spectacles
hid
certain
extent
his
vast
round
and
goggle
eyes
while
his
nose
was
irreverently
compared
thin
file
much
indeed
did
resemble
that
useful
article
that
compass
was
said
his
presence
have
made
considerable
Nasal
deviation

The
truth
being
told
however
the
only
article
really
attracted
uncle's
nose
was
tobacco

Another
peculiarity
his
was
that
always
stepped
yard
time
clenched
his
fists
were
going
hit
you
and
was
when
one
his
peculiar
humors
very
far
from
pleasant
companion

further
necessary
observe
that
lived
very
nice
house
that
very
nice
street
the
Konigstrasse
Hamburg
Though
lying
the
centre
town
was
perfectly
rural
its
aspect—half
wood
half
bricks
with
old-fashioned
gables—one
the
few
old
houses
spared
the
great
fire
When
say
nice
house
mean
handsome
house—old
tottering
and
not
exactly
comfortable
English
notions:
house
little
off
the
perpendicular
and
inclined
fall
into
the
neighboring
canal
exactly
the
house
for
wandering
artist
depict
all
the
more
that
you
could
scarcely
see
for
ivy
and
magnificent
old
tree
which
grew
over
the
door

uncle
was
rich
his
house
was
his
own
property
while
had
considerable
private
income
notion
the
best
part
his
possessions
was
his
god-daughter
Gretchen
And
the
old
cook
the
young
lady
the
Professor
and
were
the
sole
inhabitants

loved
mineralogy
loved
geology
there
was
nothing
like
pebbles—and
uncle
had
been
little
less
fury
should
have
been
the
happiest
families
prove
the
excellent
Hardwigg's
impatience
solemnly
declare
that
when
the
flowers
the
drawing-room
pots
began
grow
rose
every
morning
four
o'clock
make
them
grow
quicker
pulling
the
leaves

Having
described
uncle
will
now
give
account
our
interview

received
his
study
perfect
museum
containing
every
natural
curiosity
that
can
well
imagined—minerals
however
predominating
Every
one
was
familiar
having
been
catalogued
own
hand
uncle
apparently
oblivious
the
fact
that
had
summoned
his
presence
was
absorbed
book
was
particularly
fond
early
editions
tall
copies
and
unique
works

Wonderful
cried
tapping
his
forehead
Wonderful—wonderful

was
one
those
yellow-leaved
volumes
now
rarely
found
stalls
and
appeared
possess
but
little
value
uncle
however
was
raptures

admired
its
binding
the
clearness
its
characters
the
ease
with
which
opened
his
hand
and
repeated
aloud
half
dozen
times
that
was
very
very
old

fancy
was
making
great
fuss
about
nothing
but
was
not
province
say
the
contrary
professed
considerable
interest
the
subject
and
asked
him
what
was
about

the
Heims-Kringla
Snorre
Tarleson
said
the
celebrated
Icelandic
author
the
twelfth
century—it
true
and
correct
account
the
Norwegian
princes
who
reigned
Iceland

next
question
related
the
language
which
was
written
hoped
all
events
was
translated
into
German
uncle
was
indignant
the
very
thought
and
declared
wouldn't
give
penny
for
translation
His
delight
was
have
found
the
original
work
the
Icelandic
tongue
which
declared
one
the
most
magnificent
and
yet
simple
idioms
the
world—while
the
same
time
its
grammatical
combinations
were
the
most
varied
known
students

About
easy
German
was
insidious
remark

uncle
shrugged
his
shoulders

The
letters
all
events
said
are
rather
difficult
comprehension

Runic
manuscript
the
language
the
original
population
Iceland
invented
Odin
himself
cried
uncle
angry
ignorance

was
about
venture
upon
some
misplaced
joke
the
subject
when
small
scrap
parchment
fell
out
the
leaves
Like
hungry
man
snatching
morsel
bread
the
Professor
seized
was
about
five
inches
three
and
was
scrawled
over
the
most
extraordinary
fashion

The
lines
shown
here
are
exact
facsimile
what
was
written
the
venerable
piece
parchment—and
have
wonderful
importance
they
induced
uncle
undertake
the
most
wonderful
series
adventures
which
ever
fell
the
lot
human
beings

uncle
looked
keenly
the
document
for
some
moments
and
then
declared
that
was
Runic
The
letters
were
similar
those
the
book
but
then
what
did
they
mean
This
was
exactly
what
wanted
know

Now
had
strong
conviction
that
the
Runic
alphabet
and
dialect
were
simply
invention
mystify
poor
human
nature
was
delighted
find
that
uncle
knew
much
about
the
matter
did—which
was
nothing
all
events
the
tremulous
motion
his
fingers
made
think
And
yet
muttered
himself
old
Icelandic
sure
And
uncle
ought
have
known
for
was
perfect
polyglot
dictionary
himself
did
not
pretend
like
certain
learned
pundit
speak
the
two
thousand
languages
and
four
thousand
idioms
made
use
different
parts
the
globe
but
did
know
all
the
more
important
ones

matter
great
doubt
now
what
violent
measures
uncle's
impetuosity
might
have
led
him
had
not
the
clock
struck
two
and
our
old
French
cook
called
out
let
know
that
dinner
was
the
table

Bother
the
dinner
cried
uncle

But
was
hungry
sallied
forth
the
dining
room
where
took
usual
quarters
Out
politeness
waited
three
minutes
but
sign
uncle
the
Professor
was
surprised
was
not
usually
blind
the
pleasure
good
dinner
was
the
acme
German
luxury—parsley
soup
ham
omelette
with
sorrel
trimmings
oyster
veal
stewed
with
prunes
delicious
fruit
and
sparkling
Moselle
For
the
sake
poring
over
this
musty
old
piece
parchment
uncle
forbore
share
our
meal
satisfy
conscience
ate
for
both

The
old
cook
and
housekeeper
was
nearly
out
her
mind
After
taking
much
trouble
find
her
master
not
appear
dinner
was
her
sad
disappointment—which
she
occasionally
watched
the
havoc
was
making
the
viands
became
also
alarm
uncle
were
come
table
after
all

Suddenly
just
had
consumed
the
last
apple
and
drunk
the
last
glass
wine
terrible
voice
was
heard
great
distance
was
uncle
roaring
for
come
him
made
very
nearly
one
leap
it—so
loud
fierce
was
his
tone

CHAPTER
THE
MYSTERIOUS
PARCHMENT

declare
cried
uncle
striking
the
table
fiercely
with
his
fist
declare
you
Runic—and
contains
some
wonderful
secret
which
must
get
any
price

was
about
reply
when
stopped
Sit
down
said
quite
fiercely
and
write
dictation

obeyed

will
substitute
said
letter
our
alphabet
for
that
the
Runic:
will
then
see
what
that
will
produce
Now
begin
and
make
mistakes

The
dictation
commenced
with
the
following
incomprehensible
result:

Scarcely
giving
time
finish
uncle
snatched
the
document
from
hands
and
examined
with
the
most
rapt
and
deep
attention

should
like
know
what
means
said
after
long
period

certainly
could
not
tell
him
nor
did
expect
to—his
conversation
being
uniformly
answered
himself

declare
puts
mind
cryptograph
cried
unless
indeed
the
letters
have
been
written
without
any
real
meaning
and
yet
why
take
much
trouble
Who
knows
but
may
the
verge
some
great
discovery

candid
opinion
was
that
was
all
rubbish
But
this
opinion
kept
carefully
myself
uncle's
choler
was
not
pleasant
bear
All
this
time
was
comparing
the
book
with
the
parchment

The
manuscript
volume
and
the
smaller
document
are
written
different
hands
said
the
cryptograph
much
later
date
than
the
book
there
undoubted
proof
the
correctness
surmise
irrefragable
proof
took
be]
The
first
letter
double
which
was
only
added
the
Icelandic
language
the
twelfth
century—this
makes
the
parchment
two
hundred
years
posterior
the
volume

The
circumstances
appeared
very
probable
and
very
logical
but
was
all
surmise
appears
probable
that
this
sentence
was
written
some
owner
the
book
Now
who
was
the
owner
the
next
important
question
Perhaps
great
good
luck
may
written
somewhere
the
volume

With
these
words
Professor
Hardwigg
took
off
his
spectacles
and
taking
powerful
magnifying
glass
examined
the
book
carefully

the
fly
leaf
was
what
appeared
blot
ink
but
examination
proved
line
writing
almost
effaced
time
This
was
what
sought
and
after
some
considerable
time
made
out
these
letters:

Arne
Saknussemm
cried
joyous
and
triumphant
tone
that
not
only
Icelandic
name
but
learned
professor
the
sixteenth
century
celebrated
alchemist

bowed
sign
respect

These
alchemists
continued
Avicenna
Bacon
Lully
Paracelsus
were
the
true
the
only
learned
men
the
day
They
made
surprising
discoveries
May
not
this
Saknussemm
nephew
mine
have
hidden
this
bit
parchment
some
astounding
invention
believe
the
cryptograph
have
profound
meaning—which
must
make
out

uncle
walked
about
the
room
state
excitement
almost
impossible
describe

may
sir
timidly
observed
but
why
conceal
from
posterity
useful
worthy
discovery

Why—how
should
know
Did
not
Galileo
make
secret
his
discoveries
connection
with
Saturn
But
shall
see
Until
discover
the
meaning
this
sentence
will
neither
eat
nor
sleep

dear
uncle—
began

Nor
you
neither
added

was
lucky
had
taken
double
allowance
that
day

the
first
place
continued
there
must
clue
the
meaning
could
find
that
the
rest
would
easy
enough

began
seriously
reflect
The
prospect
going
without
food
and
sleep
was
not
promising
one
determined
best
solve
the
mystery
uncle
meanwhile
went
with
his
soliloquy

The
way
discover
easy
enough
this
document
there
are
one
hundred
and
thirty-two
letters
giving
seventy-nine
consonants
fifty-three
vowels
This
about
the
proportion
found
most
southern
languages
the
idioms
the
north
being
much
more
rich
consonants
may
confidently
predict
therefore
that
have
deal
with
southern
dialect

Nothing
could
more
logical

Now
said
Professor
Hardwigg
trace
the
particular
language

Shakespeare
says
the
question'
was
rather
satirical
reply

This
man
Saknussemm
continued
was
very
learned
man:
now
did
not
write
the
language
his
birthplace
probably
like
most
learned
men
the
sixteenth
century
wrote
Latin
however
prove
wrong
this
guess
must
try
Spanish
French
Italian
Greek
and
even
Hebrew
own
opinion
though
decidedly
favor
Latin

This
proposition
startled
Latin
was
favorite
study
and
seemed
sacrilege
believe
this
gibberish
belong
the
country
Virgil

Barbarous
Latin
all
probability
continued
uncle
but
still
Latin

Very
probably
replied
not
contradict
him

Let
see
into
the
matter
continued
uncle
here
you
see
have
series
one
hundred
and
thirty-two
letters
apparently
thrown
pell-mell
upon
paper
without
method
organization
There
are
words
which
are
composed
wholly
consonants
such
mmrnlls
others
which
are
nearly
all
vowels
the
fifth
for
instance
which
unteief
and
one
the
last
oseibo
This
appears
extraordinary
combination
Probably
shall
find
that
the
phrase
arranged
according
some
mathematical
plan
doubt
certain
sentence
has
been
written
out
and
then
jumbled
up—some
plan
which
some
figure
the
clue
Now
Harry
show
your
English
wit—what
that
figure

could
give
him
hint
thoughts
were
indeed
far
away
While
was
speaking
had
caught
sight
the
portrait
cousin
Gretchen
and
was
wondering
when
she
would
return

were
affianced
and
loved
one
another
very
sincerely
But
uncle
who
never
thought
even
such
sublunary
matters
knew
nothing
this
Without
noticing
abstraction
the
Professor
began
reading
the
puzzling
cryptograph
all
sorts
ways
according
some
theory
his
own
Presently
rousing

could
scarcely
keep
from
laughing
while
uncle
the
contrary
got
towering
passion
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
darted
out
the
room
out
the
house
and
then
taking
his
heels
was
presently
lost
sight

CHAPTER
ASTOUNDING
DISCOVERY

What
the
matter
cried
the
cook
entering
the
room
when
will
master
have
his
dinner

Never

And
his
supper

don't
know
says
will
eat
more
neither
shall
uncle
has
determined
fast
and
make
fast
until
makes
out
this
abominable
inscription
replied

You
will
starved
death
she
said

was
very
much
the
same
opinion
but
not
liking
say
sent
her
away
and
began
some
usual
work
classification
But
try
might
nothing
could
keep
from
thinking
alternately
the
stupid
manuscript
and
the
pretty
Gretchen

Several
times
thought
going
out
but
uncle
would
have
been
angry
absence
the
end
hour
allotted
task
was
done
How
pass
the
time
began
lighting
pipe
Like
all
other
students
delighted
tobacco
and
seating
myself
the
great
armchair
began
think

Where
was
uncle
could
easily
imagine
him
tearing
along
some
solitary
road
gesticulating
talking
himself
cutting
the
air
with
his
cane
and
still
thinking
the
absurd
bit
hieroglyphics
Would
hit
upon
some
clue
Would
come
home
better
humor
While
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
brain
mechanically
took
the
execrable
puzzle
and
tried
every
imaginable
way
grouping
the
letters
put
them
together
twos
threes
fours
and
fives—in
vain
Nothing
intelligible
came
out
except
that
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
made
ice
English
the
eighty-fourth
eighty-fifth
and
eighty-sixth
the
word
sir
then
last
seemed
find
the
Latin
words
rota
mutabile
ira
nec
atra

there
seems
some
truth
uncle's
notion
thought
Then
again
seemed
find
the
word
luco
which
means
sacred
wood
Then
the
third
line
appeared
make
out
labiled
perfect
Hebrew
word
and
the
last
the
syllables
mere
are
mer
which
were

this

the

the

mind
was
possessed
with

was
stifling
wanted

Mechanically
fanned
myself
with
the
document
which
now
saw
the
back
and
then
the
front

Imagine
surprise
when
glancing
the
back
the
wearisome
puzzle
the
ink
having
gone
through

made
out
Latin
words
and
among

had
discovered
the
secret

came
upon
like
flash
lightning
had
got
the
clue
All
you
had
understand
the
document
was
read
backwards
All
the
ingenious
ideas
the
Professor
were
realized
had
dictated
rightly
mere
accident
had
discovered
what
much
desired

delight
emotion
may
imagined
eyes
were
dazzled
and
trembled
that
first
could
make
nothing
One
look
however
would
tell
all
wished

Let
read
said
myself
after
drawing
long
breath

spread
before
the
table
passed
finger
over
each
letter
spelled
through
excitement
read
out

What
horror
and
stupefaction
took
possession
soul
was
like
man
who
had
received
knock-down
blow
Was
possible
that
really
read
the
terrible
secret
and
had
really
been
accomplished
man
had
dared
do—what

living
being
should
ever
know

Never
cried

Never
shall
uncle
made
aware
the
dread
secret
would
quite
capable
undertaking
the
terrible
journey
Nothing
would
check
him
nothing
stop
him
Worse
would
compel
accompany
him
and
should
lost
forever
But
such
folly
and
madness
cannot
allowed

was
almost
beside
myself
with
rage
and
fury

worthy
uncle
already
nearly
mad
cried
aloud
This
would
finish
him
some
accident
may
make
the
discovery
which
case
are
both
lost
Perish
the
fearful
secret—let
the
flames
forever
bury
oblivion

snatched
book
and
parchment
and
was
about
cast
them
into
the
fire
when
the
door
opened
and
uncle
entered

had
scarcely
time
put
down
the
wretched
documents
before
uncle
was
side
was
profoundly
absorbed
His
thoughts
were
evidently
bent
the
terrible
parchment
Some
new
combination
had
probably
struck
him
while
taking
his
walk

seated
himself
his
armchair
and
with
pen
began
make
algebraical
calculation
watched
him
with
anxious
eyes
flesh
crawled
became
probable
that
would
discover
the
secret

His
combinations
knew
now
were
useless
having
discovered
the
one
only
clue
For
three
mortal
hours
continued
without
speaking
word
without
raising
his
head
scratching
rewriting
calculating
over
and
over
again
knew
that
time
must
hit
upon
the
right
phrase
The
letters
every
alphabet
have
only
certain
number
combinations
But
then
years
might
elapse
before
would
arrive
the
correct
solution

Still
time
went
night
came
the
sounds
the
streets
ceased—and
still
uncle
went
not
even
answering
our
worthy
cook
when
she
called
supper

did
not
dare
leave
him
waved
her
away
and
last
fell
asleep
the
sofa

When
awoke
uncle
was
still
work
His
red
eyes
his
pallid
countenance
his
matted
hair
his
feverish
hands
his
hectically
flushed
cheeks
showed
how
terrible
had
been
his
struggle
with
the
impossible
and
what
fearful
fatigue
had
undergone
during
that
long
sleepless
night
made
quite
ill
look
him
Though
was
rather
severe
with
loved
him
and
heart
ached
his
sufferings
was
overcome
one
idea
that
could
not
even
get
passion
All
his
energies
were
focused
one
point
And
knew
that
speaking
one
little
word
all
this
suffering
would
cease
could
not
speak
heart
was
nevertheless
inclining
towards
him
Why
then
did
remain
silent
the
interest
uncle
himself

Nothing
shall
make
speak
muttered
will
want
follow
the
footsteps
the
other
know
him
well
His
imagination
perfect
volcano
and
make
discoveries
the
interests
geology
would
sacrifice
his
life
will
therefore
silent
and
strictly
keep
the
secret
have
discovered
reveal
would
suicidal
would
not
only
rush
himself
destruction
but
drag
with
him

crossed
arms
looked
another
way
and
smoked—resolved
never
speak

When
our
cook
wanted
out
market
any
other
errand
she
found
the
front
door
locked
and
the
key
taken
away
Was
this
done
purposely
not
Surely
Professor
Hardwigg
did
not
intend
the
old
woman
and
myself
become
martyrs
his
obstinate
will
Were
starved
death
frightful
recollection
came
mind
Once
had
fed
bits
and
scraps
for
week
while
sorted
some
curiosities
gave
the
cramp
even
think
wanted
breakfast
and
saw
way
getting
Still
resolution
held
good
would
starve
rather
than
yield
But
the
cook
began
take
seriously
task
What
was
done
She
could
not
out
and
dared
not

uncle
continued
counting
and
writing
his
imagination
seemed
have
translated
him
the
skies
neither
thought
eating
nor
drinking
this
way
twelve
o'clock
came
round
was
hungry
and
there
was
nothing
the
house
The
cook
had
eaten
the
last
bit
bread
This
could
not
did
however
until
two
when
sensations
were
terrible
After
all
began
think
the
document
very
absurd
Perhaps
might
only
gigantic
hoax
Besides
some
means
would
surely
found
keep
uncle
back
from
attempting
any
such
absurd
expedition
the
other
hand
did
attempt
anything
quixotic
should
not
compelled
accompany
him
Another
line
reasoning
partially
decided
Very
likely
would
make
the
discovery
himself
when
should
have
suffered
starvation
for
nothing
Under
the
influence
hunger
this
reasoning
appeared
admirable
determined
tell
all

The
question
now
arose
how
was
done
was
still
dwelling
the
thought
when
rose
and
put
his
hat

What
out
and
lock
Never

Uncle
began

did
not
appear
even
hear
Professor
Hardwigg
cried

What
retorted
did
you
speak

How
about
the
key

What
key—the
key
the
door

No—of
these
horrible
hieroglyphics

looked
from
under
his
spectacles
and
started
the
odd
expression
face
Rushing
forward
clutched
the
arm
and
keenly
examined
countenance
His
very
look
was
interrogation

simply
nodded

With
incredulous
shrug
the
shoulders
turned
upon
his
heel
Undoubtedly
thought
had
gone
mad

have
made
very
important
discovery

His
eyes
flashed
with
excitement
His
hand
was
lifted
menacing
attitude
For
moment
neither
spoke
hard
say
which
was
most
excited

You
don't
mean
say
that
you
have
any
idea
the
meaning
the
scrawl

was
desperate
reply
Look
the
sentence
dictated
you

Well
but
means
nothing
was
the
angry
answer

Nothing
you
read
from
left
right
but
mark
from
right
left—

Backwards
cried
uncle
wild
amazement
most
cunning
Saknussemm
and
such
blockhead

snatched
the
document
gazed
with
haggard
eye
and
read

Now
there
were
many
against

The
very
idea
going
down

determined
therefore
argue
the
point

soon
however

Scarcely

the

With

CHAPTER
START
THE
JOURNEY

You
see
the
whole
island
composed
volcanoes
said
the
Professor
and
remark
carefully
that
they
all
bear
the
name
Yocul
The
word
Icelandic
and
means
glacier
most
the
lofty
mountains
that
region
the
volcanic
eruptions
come
forth
from
icebound
caverns
Hence
the
name
applied
every
volcano
this
extraordinary
island

But
what
does
this
word
Sneffels
mean

this
question
expected
rational
answer
was
mistaken

Follow
finger
the
western
coast
Iceland
there
you
see
Reykjavik
its
capital
Follow
the
direction
one
its
innumerable
fjords
arms

and
what
you
see
below
the
sixty-fifth
degree
latitude

peninsula—very
like
thighbone
shape

And
the
centre
it—

mountain

Well
that's
Sneffels

had
nothing
say

That
Sneffels—a
mountain
about
five
thousand
feet
height
one
the
most
remarkable
the
whole
island
and
certainly
doomed
the
most
celebrated
the
world
for
through
its
crater
shall
reach
the
centre
the
earth

Impossible
cried
startled
and
shocked
the
thought

Why
impossible
said
Professor
Hardwigg
his
severest
tones

Because
its
crater
choked
with
lava
burning
rocks—by
infinite
dangers

But
extinct

That
would
make
difference

course
would
There
are
about
three
hundred
volcanoes
the
whole
surface
the
globe—but
the
greater
number
are
extinct
these
Sneffels
one
eruption
has
occurred
since
fact
has
ceased
volcano
all

After
this
what
more
could
say
Yes—I
thought
another
objection

But
what
all
this
about
Scartaris
and
the
kalends
July—

uncle
reflected
deeply
Presently
gave
forth
the
result
his
reflections
sententious
tone
What
appears
obscure
you
light
This
very
phrase
shows
how
particular
Saknussemm
his
directions
The
Sneffels
mountain
has
many
craters
careful
therefore
point
the
exact
one
which
the
highway
into
the
Interior
the
Earth
lets
know
for
this
purpose
that
about
the
end
the
month
June
the
shadow
Mount
Scartaris
falls
upon
the
one
crater
There
can
doubt
about
the
matter

uncle
had
answer
for
everything

accept
all
your
explanations
said
and
Saknussemm
right
found
out
the
entrance
the
bowels
the
earth
has
indicated
correctly
but
that
anyone
else
ever
followed
the
discovery
madness
suppose

Why
young
man

All
scientific
teaching
theoretical
and
practical
shows
impossible

care
nothing
for
theories
retorted
uncle

But
not
well-known
that
heat
increases
one
degree
for
every
seventy
feet
you
descend
into
the
earth
Which
gives
fine
idea
the
central
heat
All
the
matters
which
compose
the
globe
are
state
incandescence
even
gold
platinum
and
the
hardest
rocks
are
state
fusion
What
would
become
Don't
alarmed
the
heat
boy

How
Neither
you
nor
anybody
else
know
anything
about
the
real
state
the
earth's
interior
All
modern
experiments
tend
explode
the
older
theories
Were
any
such
heat
exist
the
upper
crust
the
earth
would
shattered
atoms
and
the
world
would
end

long
learned
and
not
uninteresting
discussion
followed
which
ended
this
wise:

not
believe
the
dangers
and
difficulties
which
you
Henry
seem
multiply
and
the
only
way
learn
like
Arne
Saknussemm
and
see

Well
cried
overcome
last
let
and
see
Though
how
can
that
the
dark
another
mystery

Fear
nothing
shall
overcome
these
and
many
other
difficulties
Besides
approach
the
centre
expect
find
luminous—

Nothing
impossible

And
now
that
have
come
thorough
understanding
not
word
any
living
soul
Our
success
depends
secrecy
and
dispatch

Thus
ended
our
memorable
conference
which
roused
perfect
fever
Leaving
uncle
went
forth
like
one
possessed
Reaching
the
banks
the
Elbe
began
think
Was
all
had
heard
really
and
truly
possible
Was
uncle
his
sober
senses
and
could
the
interior
the
earth
reached
Was
the
victim
madman
was
discoverer
rare
courage
and
grandeur
conception

certain
extent
was
anxious
off
was
afraid
enthusiasm
would
cool
determined
pack
once
the
end
hour
however
way
home
found
that
feelings
had
very
much
changed

I'm
all
abroad
cried
nightmare—I
must
have
dreamed
this
moment
came
face
face
with
Gretchen
whom
warmly
embraced

you
have
come
meet
she
said
how
good
you
But
what
the
matter

Well
was
use
mincing
the
matter
told
her
all
She
listened
with
awe
and
for
some
minutes
she
could
not
speak

Well
last
said
rather
anxiously

What
magnificent
journey
were
only
man
journey
worthy
the
nephew
Professor
Hardwigg
should
look
upon
honor
accompany
him

dear
Gretchen
thought
you
would
the
first
cry
out
against
this
mad
enterprise

the
contrary
glory
magnificent
splendid—an
idea
worthy
father
Henry
Lawson
envy
you

This
was
were
conclusive
The
final
blow
all

When
entered
the
house
found
uncle
surrounded
workmen
and
porters
who
were
packing
was
pulling
and
hauling
bell

Where
have
you
been
wasting
your
time
Your
portmanteau
not
packed—my
papers
are
not
order—the
precious
tailor
has
not
brought
clothes
nor
gaiters—the
key
carpet
bag
gone

looked
him
stupefied
And
still
tugged
away
the
bell

are
really
off
then
said

Yes—of
course
and
yet
you
out
for
stroll
unfortunate
boy

And
when
The
day
after
tomorrow
daybreak

heard
more
but
darted
off
little
bedchamber
and
locked
myself
There
was
doubt
about
now
uncle
had
been
hard
work
all
the
afternoon
The
garden
was
full
ropes
rope
ladders
torches
gourds
iron
clamps
crowbars
alpenstocks
and
pickaxes—enough
load
ten
men

passed
terrible
night
was
called
early
the
next
day
learn
that
the
resolution
uncle
was
unchanged
and
irrevocable
also
found
cousin
and
affianced
wife
warm
the
subject
was
her
father

Next
day
five
o'clock
the
morning
the
post
chaise
was
the
door
Gretchen
and
the
old
cook
received
the
keys
the
house
and
scarcely
pausing
wish
anyone
good-by
started
our
adventurous
journey
into
the
centre

earth

the
western
side
Seeland

Here
took
another
railway
which
three
hours
brought
the
capital
Copenhagen
where
scarcely
taking
time
for
refreshment
uncle
hurried
out
present
one
his
letters
introduction
was
the
director
the
Museum
Antiquities
who
having
been
informed
that
were
tourists
bound
for
Iceland
did
all
could
assist
One
wretched
hope
sustained
now
Perhaps
vessel
was
bound
for
such
distant
parts

Alas
little
Danish
schooner
the
Valkyrie
was
sail
the
second
June
for
Reykjavik
The
captain
Bjarne
was
board
and
was
rather
surprised
the
energy
and
cordiality
with
which
his
future
passenger
shook
him
the
hand
him
voyage
Iceland
was
merely
matter
course
uncle
the
other
hand
considered
the
event
sublime
importance
The
honest
sailor
took
advantage
the
Professor's
enthusiasm
double
the
fare

Tuesday
morning
seven
o'clock
board
said
Bjarne
handing
our
receipts

Excellent
Capital
Glorious
remarked
uncle
sat
down
late
breakfast
refresh
yourself
boy
and
will
take
run
through
the
town

Our
meal
concluded
went
the
Kongens-Nye-Torw
the
king's
magnificent
palace
the
beautiful
bridge
over
the
canal
near
the
Museum
the
immense
cenotaph
Thorwaldsen
with
its
hideous
naval
groups
the
castle
Rosenberg
and
all
the
other
lions
the
place-none
which
uncle
even
saw
absorbed
was
his
anticipated
triumphs

But
one
thing
struck
his
fancy
and
that
was
certain
singular
steeple
situated
the
Island
Amak
which
the
southeast
quarter
the
city
Copenhagen
uncle
once
ordered
turn
steps
that
way
and
accordingly
went
board
the
steam
ferry
boat
which
does
duty
the
canal
and
very
soon
reached
the
noted
dockyard
quay

the
first
instance
crossed
some
narrow
streets
where
met
numerous
groups
galley
slaves
with
particolored
trousers
grey
and
yellow
working
under
the
orders
and
the
sticks
severe
taskmasters
and
finally
reached
the
Vor-Frelser's-Kirk

This
church
exhibited
nothing
remarkable
itself
fact
the
worthy
Professor
had
only
been
attracted
one
circumstance
which
was
that
its
rather
elevated
steeple
started
from
circular
platform
after
which
there
was
exterior
staircase
which
wound
round
the
very
summit

Let
ascend
said
uncle

But
never
could
climb
church
towers
cried
subject
dizziness
head

The
very
reason
why
you
should
want
cure
you
bad
habit

But
good
sir—

tell
you
come
What
the
use
wasting
much
valuable
time

was
impossible
dispute
the
dictatorial
commands
uncle
yielded
with
groan
payment
fee
verger
gave
the
key
for
one
was
not
partial
the
ascent
uncle
once
showed
the
way
running
the
steps
like
schoolboy
followed
well
could
though
sooner
was
outside
the
tower
than
head
began
swim
There
was
nothing
the
eagle
about
The
earth
was
enough
for
and
ambitious
desire
soar
ever
entered
mind
Still
things
did
not
badly
until
had
ascended
steps
and
was
near
the
platform
when
began
feel
the
rush
cold
air
could
scarcely
stand
when
clutching
the
railings
looked
upwards
The
railing
was
frail
enough
but
nothing
those
which
skirted
the
terrible
winding
staircase
that
appeared
from
where
stood
ascend
the
skies

Now
then
Henry

can't
cried
accents
despair

Are
you
after
all
coward
sir
said
uncle
pitiless
tone
say

this
there
was
reply
possible
And
yet
the
keen
air
acted
violently
nervous
system
sky
earth
all
seemed
swim
round
while
the
steeple
rocked
like
ship
legs
gave
way
like
those
drunken
man
crawled
upon
hands
and
knees
hauled
myself
slowly
crawling
like
snake
Presently
closed
eyes
and
allowed
myself
dragged
upwards

Look
around
you
said
uncle
stern
voice
heaven
knows
what
profound
abysses
you
may
have
look
down
This
excellent
practice

Slowly
and
shivering
all
the
while
with
cold
opened
eyes
What
then
did
see
first
glance
was
upwards
the
cold
fleecy
clouds
which
some
optical
delusion
appeared
stand
still
while
the
steeple
the
weathercock
and
our
two
selves
were
carried
swiftly
along
Far
away
one
side
could
seen
the
grassy
plain
while
the
other
lay
the
sea
bathed
translucent
light
The
Sund
Sound
call
could
discovered
beyond
the
point
Elsinore
crowded
with
white
sails
which
that
distance
looked
like
the
wings
seagulls
while
the
east
could
made
out
the
far-off
coast
Sweden
The
whole
appeared
magic
panorama

But
faint
and
bewildered
was
there
was
remedy
for
Rise
and
stand
must
Despite
protestations
first
lesson
lasted
quite
hour
When
nearly
two
hours
later
reached
the
bosom
mother
earth
was
like
rheumatic
old
man
bent
double
with
pain

Enough
for
one
day
said
uncle
rubbing
his
hands
will
begin
again
tomorrow

There
was
remedy
lessons
lasted
five
days
and
the
end
that
period
ascended
blithely
enough
and
found
myself
able
look
down
into
the
depths
below
without
even
winking
and
with
some
degree
pleasure

CHAPTER
OUR
VOYAGE
ICELAND

The
hour
departure
came
last
The
night
before
the
worthy
Thompson
brought
the
most
cordial
letters
introduction
for
Baron
Trampe
Governor
Iceland
for
Pictursson
coadjutor
the
bishop
and
for
Finsen
mayor
the
town
Reykjavik
return
uncle
nearly
crushed
his
hands
warmly
did
shake
them

the
second
the
month
two
the
morning
our
precious
cargo
luggage
was
taken
board
the
good
ship
Valkyrie
followed
and
were
very
politely
introduced
the
captain
small
cabin
with
two
standing
bed
places
neither
very
well
ventilated
nor
very
comfortable
But
the
cause
science
men
are
expected
suffer

Well
and
have
fair
wind
cried
uncle
his
most
mellifluous
accents

excellent
wind
replied
Captain
Bjarne
shall
leave
the
Sound
going
free
with
all
sails
set

few
minutes
afterwards
the
schooner
started
before
the
wind
under
all
the
canvas
she
could
carry
and
entered
the
channel
hour
later
the
capital
Denmark
seemed
sink
into
the
waves
and
were
great
distance
from
the
coast
Elsinore
uncle
was
delighted
for
myself
moody
and
dissatisfied
appeared
almost
expect
glimpse
the
ghost
Hamlet

Sublime
madman
thought
you
doubtless
would
approve
our
proceedings
You
might
perhaps
even
follow
the
centre
the
earth
there
resolve
your
eternal
doubts

But
ghost
anything
else
appeared
upon
the
ancient
walls
The
fact
the
castle
much
later
than
the
time
the
heroic
prince
Denmark
now
the
residence
the
keeper
the
Strait
the
Sound
and
through
that
Sound
more
than
fifteen
thousand
vessels
all
nations
pass
every
year

The
castle
Kronborg
soon
disappeared
the
murky
atmosphere
well
the
tower
Helsinborg
which
raises
its
head
the
Swedish
Bank
And
here
the
schooner
began
feel
earnest
the
breezes
the
Kattegat
The
Valkyrie
was
swift
enough
but
with
all
sailing
boats
there
the
same
uncertainty
Her
cargo
was
coal
furniture
pottery
woolen
clothing
and
load
corn
usual
the
crew
was
small
five
Danes
doing
the
whole
the
work

How
long
will
the
voyage
last
asked
uncle

Well
should
think
about
ten
days
replied
the
skipper
unless
indeed
meet
with
some
northeast
gales
among
the
Faroe
Islands

all
events
there
will
very
considerable
delay
cried
the
impatient
Professor

Hardwigg
said
the
captain
fear
that
all
events
shall
get
there
some
day

Towards
evening
the
schooner
doubled
Cape
Skagen
the
northernmost
part
Denmark
crossed
the
Skagerrak
during
the
night—skirted
the
extreme
point
Norway
through
the
gut
Cape
Lindesnes
and
then
reached
the
Northern
Seas
Two
days
later
were
not
far
from
the
coast
Scotland
somewhere
near
what
Danish
sailors
call
Peterhead
and
then
the
Valkyrie
stretched
out
direct
for
the
Faroe
Islands
between
Orkney
and
Shetland
Our
vessel
now
felt
the
full
force
the
ocean
waves
and
the
wind
shifting
with
great
difficulty
made
the
Faroe
Isles
the
eighth
day
the
captain
made
out
Myganness
the
westernmost
the
isles
and
from
that
moment
headed
direct
for
Portland
cape
the
southern
shores
the
singular
island
for
which
were
bound

The
voyage
offered
incident
worthy
record
bore
very
well
but
uncle
his
great
annoyance
and
even
shame
was
remarkably
seasick
This
mal
mer
troubled
him
the
more
that
prevented
him
from
questioning
Captain
Bjarne
the
subject
Sneffels
the
means
communication
and
the
facilities
transport
All
these
explanations
had
adjourn
the
period
his
arrival
His
time
meanwhile
was
spent
lying
bed
groaning
and
dwelling
anxiously
the
hoped—for
termination
the
voyage
didn't
pity
him

the
eleventh
day
sighted
Cape
Portland
over
which
towered
Mount
Myrdals
Yokul
which
the
weather
being
clear
made
out
very
readily
The
cape
itself
nothing
but
huge
mount
granite
standing
naked
and
alone
meet
the
Atlantic
waves
The
Valkyrie
kept
off
the
coast
steering
the
westward
all
sides
were
seen
whole
schools
whales
and
sharks
After
some
hours
came
sight
solitary
rock
the
ocean
forming
mighty
vault
through
which
the
foaming
waves
poured
with
intense
fury
The
islets
Westman
appeared
leap
from
the
ocean
being
low
the
water
scarcely
seen
until
you
were
right
upon
them
From
that
moment
the
schooner
was
steered
the
westward
order
round
Cape
Reykjanes
the
western
point
Iceland

uncle
his
great
disgust
was
unable
even
crawl
deck
heavy
sea
was
and
thus
lost
the
first
view
the
Land
Promise
Forty-eight
hours
later
after
storm
which
drove
far
sea
under
bare
poles
came
once
more
sight
land
and
were
boarded
pilot
who
after
three
hours
dangerous
navigation
brought
the
schooner
safely
anchor
the
bay
Faxa
before
Reykjavik

uncle
came
out
his
cabin
pale
haggard
thin
but
full
enthusiasm
his
eyes
dilated
with
pleasure
and
satisfaction
Nearly
the
whole
population
the
town
was
foot
see
land
The
fact
was
that
scarcely
any
one
them
but
expected
some
goods
the
periodical
vessel

Professor
Hardwigg
was
haste
leave
his
prison
rather
called
his
hospital
but
before
attempted
caught
hold
hand
led
the
quarterdeck
the
schooner
took
arm
with
his
left
hand
and
pointed
inland
with
his
right
over
the
northern
part
the
bay
where
rose
high
two-peaked
mountain—a
double
cone
covered
with
eternal
snow

Behold
whispered
awe-stricken
voice
behold—Mount
Sneffels

Then
without
further
remark
put
his
finger
his
lips
frowned
darkly
and
descended
into
the
small
boat
which
awaited
followed
and
few
minutes
stood
upon
the
soil
mysterious
Iceland

Scarcely
were
fairly
shore
when
there
appeared
before
man
excellent
appearance
wearing
the
costume
military
officer
was
however
but
civil
servant
magistrate
the
governor
the
island—Baron
Trampe
The
Professor
knew
whom
had
deal
with
therefore
handed
him
the
letters
from
Copenhagen
and
brief
conversation
Danish
followed
which
course
was
stranger
and
for
very
good
reason
for
did
not
know
the
language
which
they
conversed
afterwards
heard
however
that
Baron
Trampe
placed
himself
entirely
the
beck
and
call
Professor
Hardwigg

uncle
was
most
graciously
received
Finsen
the
mayor
who
far
costume
went
was
quite
military
the
governor
but
also
from
character
and
occupation
quite
pacific
for
his
coadjutor
Pictursson
was
absent
episcopal
visit
the
northern
portion
the
diocese
were
therefore
compelled
defer
the
pleasure
being
presented
him
His
absence
was
however
more
than
compensated
the
presence
Fridriksson
professor
natural
science
the
college
Reykjavik
man
invaluable
ability
This
modest
scholar
spoke
languages
save
Icelandic
and
Latin
When
therefore
addressed
himself
the
language
Horace
once
came
understand
one
another
was
fact
the
only
person
that
did
thoroughly
understand
during
the
whole
period
residence
this
benighted
island

Out
three
rooms
which
his
house
was
composed
two
were
placed
our
service
and
few
hours
were
installed
with
all
our
baggage
the
amount
which
rather
astonished
the
simple
inhabitants
Reykjavik

Now
Harry
said
uncle
rubbing
his
hands
goes
well
the
worse
difficulty
now
over

How
the
worse
difficulty
over
cried
fresh
amazement

Doubtless
Here
are
Iceland
Nothing
more
remains
but
descend
into
the
bowels
the
earth

Well
sir
certain
extent
you
are
right
have
only
down—but
far
concerned
that
not
the
question
want
know
how
are
get
again

That
the
least
part
the
business
and
does
not
any
way
trouble
the
meantime
there
not
hour
lose
about
visit
the
public
library
Very
likely
may
find
there
some
manuscripts
from
the
hand
Saknussemm
shall
glad
consult
them

the
meanwhile
replied
will
take
walk
through
the
town
Will
you
not
likewise
feel
interest
the
subject
said
uncle
What
for
curious
this
island
not
what
above
the
surface
but
what
below

bowed
way
reply
put
hat
and
furred
cloak
and
went
out

was
not
easy
matter
lose
oneself
the
two
streets
Reykjavik
had
therefore
need
ask
way
The
town
lies
flat
and
marshy
plain
between
two
hills
vast
field
lava
skirts
one
side
falling
away
terraces
towards
the
sea
the
other
hand
the
large
bay
Faxa
bordered
the
north
the
enormous
glacier
Sneffels
and
which
bay
the
Valkyrie
was
then
the
only
vessel
anchor
Generally
there
were
one
two
English
French
gunboats
watch
and
protect
the
fisheries
the
offing
They
were
now
however
absent
duty

The
longest
the
streets
Reykjavik
runs
parallel
the
shore
this
street
the
merchants
and
traders
live
wooden
huts
made
with
beams
wood
painted
red—mere
log
huts
such
you
find
the
wilds
America
The
other
street
situated
more
the
west
runs
toward
little
lake
between
the
residences
the
bishop
and
the
other
personages
not
engaged
commerce

had
soon
seen
all
wanted
these
weary
and
dismal
thoroughfares
Here
and
there
was
strip
discolored
turf
like
old
worn-out
bit
woolen
carpet
and
now
and
then
bit
kitchen
garden
which
grew
potatoes
cabbage
and
lettuce
almost
diminutive
enough
suggest
the
idea
Lilliput

the
centre
the
new
commercial
street
found
the
public
cemetery
enclosed
earthen
wall
Though
not
very
large
appeared
not
likely
filled
for
centuries
From
hence
went
the
house
the
Governor—a
mere
hut
comparison
with
the
Mansion
House
Hamburg—but
palace
alongside
the
other
Icelandic
houses
Between
the
little
lake
and
the
town
was
the
church
built
simple
Protestant
style
and
composed
calcined
stones
thrown
volcanic
action
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
high
winds
its
red
tiles
were
blown
out
the
great
annoyance
the
pastor
and
congregation
Upon
eminence
close
hand
was
the
national
school
which
were
taught
Hebrew
English
French
and
Danish

three
hours
tour
was
complete
The
general
impression
upon
mind
was
sadness
trees
vegetation
speak—on
all
sides
volcanic
peaks—the
huts
turf
and
earth—more
like
roofs
than
houses
Thanks
the
heat
these
residences
grass
grows
the
roof
which
grass
carefully
cut
for
hay
saw
but
few
inhabitants
during
excursion
but
met
crowd
the
beach
drying
salting
and
loading
codfish
the
principal
article
exportation
The
men
appeared
robust
but
heavy
fair-haired
like
Germans
but
pensive
mien—exiles
higher
scale
the
ladder
humanity
than
the
Eskimos
but
thought
much
more
unhappy
since
with
superior
perceptions
they
are
compelled
live
within
the
limits
the
Polar
Circle

Sometimes
they
gave
vent
convulsive
laugh
but
chance
did
they
smile
Their
costume
consists
coarse
capote
black
wool
known
Scandinavian
countries
the
vadmel
broad-brimmed
hat
trousers
red
serge
and
piece
leather
tied
with
strings
for
shoe—a
coarse
kind
moccasin
The
women
though
sad-looking
and
mournful
had
rather
agreeable
features
without
much
expression
They
wear
bodice
and
petticoat
somber
vadmel
When
unmarried
they
wear
little
brown
knitted
cap
over
crown
plaited
hair
but
when
married
they
cover
their
heads
with
colored
handkerchief
over
which
they
tie
white
scarf

CHAPTER
CONVERSATION
AND
DISCOVERY

When
returned
dinner
was
ready
This
meal
was
devoured
worthy
relative
with
avidity
and
voracity
His
shipboard
diet
had
turned
his
interior
into
perfect
gulf
The
repast
which
was
more
Danish
than
Icelandic
was
itself
nothing
but
the
excessive
hospitality
our
host
made
enjoy
doubly

The
conversation
turned
upon
scientific
matters
and
Fridriksson
asked
uncle
what
thought
the
public
library

Library
sir
cried
uncle
appears
collection
useless
odd
volumes
and
beggarly
amount
empty
shelves

What
cried
Fridriksson
why
have
eight
thousand
volumes
most
rare
and
valuable
works—some
the
Scandinavian
language
besides
all
the
new
publications
from
Copenhagen

Eight
thousand
volumes
dear
sir—why
where
are
they
cried
uncle

Scattered
over
the
country
Professor
Hardwigg
are
very
studious
dear
sir
though
live
Iceland
Every
farmer
every
laborer
every
fisherman
can
both
read
and
write—and
think
that
books
instead
being
locked
cupboards
far
from
the
sight
students
should
distributed
widely
possible
The
books
our
library
are
therefore
passed
from
hand
hand
without
returning
the
library
shelves
perhaps
for
years

Then
when
foreigners
visit
you
there
nothing
for
them
see

Well
sir
foreigners
have
their
own
libraries
and
our
first
consideration
that
our
humbler
classes
should
highly
educated
Fortunately
the
love
study
innate
the
Icelandic
people
founded
Literary
Society
and
Mechanics'
Institute
many
foreign
scholars
eminence

uncle
who
already
belonged
nearly
every
literary
and
scientific
institution
Europe
immediately
yielded
the
amiable
wishes
good
Fridriksson

And
now
said
after
many
expressions
gratitude
and
good
will
you
will
tell
what
books
you
expected
find
perhaps
may
some
assistance
you

watched
uncle
keenly
For
minute
two
hesitated
unwilling
speak
speak
openly
was
perhaps
unveil
his
projects
Nevertheless
after
some
reflection
made
his
mind

Well
Fridriksson
said
easy
unconcerned
kind
way
was
desirous
ascertaining
among
other
valuable
works
you
had
any
the
learned
Arne
Saknussemm

Arne
Saknussemm
cried
the
Professor
Reykjavik
you
speak
one
the
most
distinguished
scholars
the
sixteenth
century
the
great
naturalist
the
great
alchemist
the
great
traveler

Exactly
One
the
most
distinguished
men
connected
with
Icelandic
science
and
literature

you
say
sir—

man
illustrious
above
all

Yes
sir
all
this
true
but
his
works

have
none
them

Not
Iceland

There
are
none
Iceland
elsewhere
answered
the
other
sadly

Why
Because
Arne
Saknussemm
was
persecuted
for
heresy
and
his
works
were
publicly
burnt
Copenhagen
the
hands
the
common
hangman

Very
good
capital
murmured
uncle
the
great
astonishment
the
worthy
Icelander

You
said
sir—

Yes
yes
all
clear
see
the
link
the
chain
everything
explained
and
now
understand
why
Arne
Saknussemm
put
out
court
forced
hide
his
magnificent
discoveries
was
compelled
conceal
beneath
the
veil
incomprehensible
cryptograph
the
secret—

What
secret

secret—which
stammered
uncle

Have
you
discovered
some
wonderful
manuscript
cried
Fridriksson

was
carried
away
enthusiasm
mere
supposition

Very
good
sir
But
really
turn
another
subject
hope
you
will
not
leave
our
island
without
examining
into
its
mineralogical
riches

Well
the
fact
rather
late
many
learned
men
have
been
here
before
Yes
yes
but
there
still
much
done
cried
Fridriksson

You
think
said
uncle
his
eyes
twinkling
with
hidden
satisfaction

Yes
you
have
idea
how
many
unknown
mountains
glaciers
volcanoes
there
are
which
remain
studied
Without
moving
from
where
sit
can
show
you
one
Yonder
the
edge
the
horizon
you
see
Sneffels

yes
Sneffels
said
uncle

One
the
most
curious
volcanoes
existence
the
crater
which
has
been
rarely
visited

Extinct

Extinct
any
time
these
five
hundred
years
was
the
ready
reply

Well
said
uncle
who
dug
his
nails
into
his
flesh
and
pressed
his
knees
tightly
together
prevent
himself
leaping
with
joy
have
great
mind
begin
studies
with
examination
the
geological
mysteries
this
Mount
Seffel—Feisel—what
you
call
Sneffels
dear
sir

This
portion
the
conversation
took
place
Latin
and
therefore
understood
all
that
had
been
said
could
scarcely
keep
countenance
when
found
uncle
cunningly
concealing
his
delight
and
satisfaction
must
confess
that
his
artful
grimaces
put
conceal
his
happiness
made
him
look
like
new
Mephistopheles

Yes
yes
continued
your
proposition
delights
will
endeavor
climb
the
summit
Sneffels
and
possible
will
descend
into
its
crater

very
much
regret
continued
Fridriksson
that
occupation
will
entirely
preclude
the
possibility
accompanying
you
would
have
been
both
pleasurable
and
profitable
could
have
spared
the
time

thousand
times
cried
uncle
not
wish
disturb
the
serenity
any
man
thank
you
however
with
all
heart
The
presence
one
learned
yourself
would
doubt
have
been
most
useful
but
the
duties
your
office
and
profession
before
everything

the
innocence
his
simple
heart
our
host
did
not
perceive
the
irony
these
remarks

entirely
approve
your
project
continued
the
Icelander
after
some
further
remarks
good
idea
begin
examining
this
volcano
You
will
make

But

Why

replied
the
other

What
done

You
must
land
along
the
coast
longer
but
much
more
interesting

Then
must
have

have
your
very

Somebody

Yes
inhabitant
the

which
Sneffels
situated
very
shrewd
and
worthy
man
with
whom
you
will
pleased
speaks
Danish
like
Dane

When
can
see
him—today

tomorrow
will
not
here
before

Tomorrow
replied
uncle
with
deep
sigh

The
conversation
ended
compliments
both
sides
During
the
dinner
uncle
had
learned
much
the
history
Arne
Saknussemm
the
reasons
for
his
mysterious
and
hieroglyphical
document
also
became
aware
that
his
host
would
not
accompany
him
his
adventurous
expedition
and
that
next
day
should
have
guide

CHAPTER
THE
EIDER-DOWN
HUNTER—OFF
LAST

That
evening
took
brief
walk
the
shore
near
Reykjavik
after
which
returned
early
sleep
bed
coarse
planks
where
slept
the
sleep
the
just
When
awoke
heard
uncle
speaking
loudly
the
next
room
rose
hastily
and
joined
him
was
talking
Danish
with
man
tall
stature
and
perfectly
Herculean
build
This
man
appeared
possessed
very
great
strength
His
eyes
which
started
rather
prominently
from
very
large
head
the
face
belonging
which
was
simple
and
naive
appeared
very
quick
and
intelligent
Very
long
hair
which
even
England
would
have
been
accounted
exceedingly
red
fell
over
his
athletic
shoulders
This
native
Iceland
was
active
and
supple
appearance
though
scarcely
moved
his
arms
being
fact
one
those
men
who
despise
the
habit
gesticulation
common
southern
people

Everything
this
man's
manner
revealed
calm
and
phlegmatic
temperament
There
was
nothing
indolent
about
him
but
his
appearance
spoke
tranquillity
was
one
those
who
never
seemed
expect
anything
from
anybody
who
liked
work
when
thought
proper
and
whose
philosophy
nothing
could
astonish
trouble

began
comprehend
his
character
simply
from
the
way
which
listened
the
wild
and
impassioned
verbiage
worthy
uncle
While
the
excellent
Professor
spoke
sentence
after
sentence
stood
with
folded
arms
utterly
still
motionless
all
uncle's
gesticulations
When
wanted
say
moved
his
head
from
left
right
when
acquiesced
nodded
slightly
that
you
could
scarcely
see
the
undulation
his
head
This
economy
motion
was
carried
the
length
avarice

Judging
from
his
appearance
should
have
been
long
time
before
had
suspected
him
what
was
mighty
hunter
Certainly
his
manner
was
not
likely
frighten
the
game
How
then
did
contrive
get
his
prey

surprise
was
slightly
modified
when
knew
that
this
tranquil
and
solemn
personage
was
only
hunter
the
eider
duck
the
down
which
after
all
the
greatest
source
the
Icelanders'
wealth

the
early
days
summer
the
female
the
eider
pretty
sort
duck
builds
its
nest
amid
the
rocks
the
fjords—the
name
given
all
narrow
gulfs
Scandinavian
countries—with
which
every
part
the
island
indented
sooner
has
the
eider
duck
made
her
nest
than
she
lines
the
inside
with
the
softest
down
from
her
breast
Then
comes
the
hunter
trader
taking
away
the
nest
the
poor
bereaved
female
begins
her
task
over
again
and
this
continues
long
any
eider
down
found

When
she
can
find
more
the
male
bird
sets
work
see
what
can
however
his
down
not
soft
and
has
therefore
commercial
value
the
hunter
does
not
take
the
trouble
rob
him
his
nest
lining
The
nest
accordingly
finished
the
eggs
are
laid
the
little
ones
are
born
and
next
year
the
harvest
eider
down
again
collected

Now
the
eider
duck
never
selects
steep
rocks
aspects
build
its
nest
but
rather
sloping
and
low
cliffs
near
the
sea
the
Icelandic
hunter
can
carry
his
trade
operations
without
much
difficulty
like
farmer
who
has
neither
plow
sow
nor
harrow
only
collect
his
harvest

This
grave
sententious
silent
person
phlegmatic
Englishman
the
French
stage
was
named
Hans
Bjelke
had
called
upon
consequence
the
recommendation
Fridriksson
was
fact
our
future
guide
struck
that
had
sought
the
world
over
could
not
have
found
greater
contradiction
impulsive
uncle

They
however
readily
understood
one
another
Neither
them
had
any
thought
about
money
one
was
ready
take
all
that
was
offered
him
the
other
ready
offer
anything
that
was
asked
may
readily
conceived
then
that
understanding
was
soon
come
between
them

Now
the
understanding
was
that
was
take
the
village
Stapi
situated
the
southern
slope
the
peninsula
Sneffels
the
very
foot
the
volcano
Hans
the
guide
told
the
distance
was
about
twenty-two
miles
journey
which
uncle
supposed
would
take
about
two
days

But
when
uncle
came
understand
that
they
were
Danish
miles
eight
thousand
yards
each
was
obliged
more
moderate
his
ideas
and
considering
the
horrible
roads
had
follow
allow
eight
ten
days
for
the
journey

Four
horses
were
prepared
for
two
carry
the
baggage
and
two
bear
the
important
weight
myself
and
uncle
Hans
declared
that
nothing
ever
would
make
him
climb
the
back
any
animal
knew
every
inch
that
part
the
coast
and
promised
take
the
very
shortest
way

His
engagement
with
uncle
was
means
cease
with
our
arrival
Stapi
was
further
remain
his
service
during
the
whole
time
required
for
the
completion
his
scientific
investigations
the
fixed
salary
three
rix-dollars
week
being
exactly
fourteen
shillings
and
twopence
minus
one
farthing
English
currency
One
stipulation
however
was
made
the
guide—the
money
was
paid
him
every
Saturday
night
failing
which
his
engagement
was
end

The
day
our
departure
was
fixed
uncle
wished
hand
the
eider-down
hunter
advance
but
refused
one
emphatic
word—

Efter

Which
being
translated
from
Icelandic
into
plain
English
means—After

The
treaty
concluded
our
worthy
guide
retired
without
another
word

splendid
fellow
said
uncle
only
little
suspects
the
marvelous
part
about
play
the
history
the
world

You
mean
then
cried
amazement
that
should
accompany
the
interior
the
earth
yes
replied
uncle
Why
not

There
were
yet
forty-eight
hours
elapse
before
made
our
final
start
great
regret
our
whole
time
was
taken
making
preparations
for
our

All
our
industry

were
devoted

object

other
the

There
were

The
instruments
were

Why
these

were

was
impossible
for

had
every
reason
believe
that
had
neither

nor
savage
natives
fear
uncle
the

was
quite
devoted

above
all
was
very
careful
with
his
provision

three
iron-shod
Alpine
poles
hatchet

You
may
conceive
that
the
whole
made
tolerable
parcel
especially
when
mention
that
the
ladder
itself
was
three
hundred
feet
long

Then
there
came
the
important
question

was
not
very
large
but
tolerably
satisfactory
for

The
only
liquid

was
Schiedam

present
and
was
afterwards
sorry
hear
that
and
the
governor
did
not
agree
some
matters
connected
with
the
administration
the
island
Unfortunately
the
consequence
was
that
did
not
understand
word
that
was
said
dinner—a
kind
semiofficial
reception
One
thing
can
say
uncle
never
left
off
speaking

The
next
day
our
labor
came
end
Our
worthy
host
delighted
uncle
Professor
Hardwigg
giving
him
good
map
Iceland
most
important
and
precious
document
for
mineralogist

Our
last
evening
was
spent
long
conversation
with
Fridriksson
whom
liked
very
much—the
more
that
never
expected
see
him
anyone
else
again
After
this
agreeable
way
spending

tried
sleep

with
the
exception

dozes

was
miserable

five
o'clock
the
morning
was
awakened
from
the
only
real
half
hour's
sleep
the
night
the
loud
neighing
horses
under
window
hastily
dressed
myself
and
went
down
into
the
street
Hans
was
engaged
putting
the
finishing
stroke
our
baggage
which
did
silent
quiet
way
that
won
admiration
and
yet
did
admirably
well
uncle
wasted
great
deal
breath
giving
him
directions
but
worthy
Hans
took
not
the
slightest
notice
his
words

six
o'clock
all
our
preparations
were
completed
and
Fridriksson
shook
hands
heartily
with
uncle
thanked
him
warmly
the
Icelandic
language
for
his
kind
hospitality
speaking
truly
from
the
heart

for
myself
put
together
few
best
Latin
phrases
and
paid
him
the
highest
compliments

This
fraternal
and
friendly
duty
performed
sallied
forth
and
mounted
our
horses

soon
were
quite
ready
Fridriksson
advanced
and
way
farewell
called
after
the
words
Virgil—words
which
appeared
have
been
made
for
travelers
starting
for
uncertain
destination:

quacunque

And

CHAPTER
OUR
START—WE
MEET
WITH
ADVENTURES
THE
WAY

The
weather
was
overcast
but
settled
when
commenced
our
adventurous
and
perilous
journey
had
neither
fear
fatiguing
heat
nor
drenching
rain
was
fact
real
tourist
weather

there
was
nothing
liked
better
than
horse
exercise
the
pleasure
riding
through
unknown
country
caused
the
early
part
our
enterprise
particularly
agreeable
began
enjoy
the
exhilarating
delight
traveling
life
desire
gratification
and
liberty
The
truth
that
spirits
rose
rapidly
that
began
indifferent
what
had
once
appeared
terrible
journey

After
all
said
myself
what
risk
Simply
take
journey
through
curious
country
climb
remarkable
mountain
and
the
worst
comes
the
worst
descend
into
the
crater
extinct
volcano

There
could
doubt
that
this
was
all
this
terrible
Saknussemm
had
done
the
existence
gallery
subterraneous
passages
leading
into
the
interior
the
earth
the
idea
was
simply
absurd
the
hallucination
distempered
imagination
All
then
that
may
required
will
cheerfully
and
will
create
difficulty

was
just
before
left
Reykjavik
that
came
this
decision

Hans
our
extraordinary
guide
went
first
walking
with
steady
rapid
unvarying
step
Our
two
horses
with
the
luggage
followed
their
own
accord
without
requiring
whip
spur
uncle
and
came
behind
cutting
very
tolerable
figure
upon
our
small
but
vigorous
animals

Iceland
one
the
largest
islands
Europe
contains
thirty
thousand
square
miles
surface
and
has
about
seventy
thousand
inhabitants
Geographers
have
divided
into
four
parts
and
had
cross
the
southwest
quarter
which
the
vernacular
called
Sudvestr
Fjordungr

Hans
taking
his
departure
from
Reykjavik
had
followed
the
line
the
sea
took
our
way
through
poor
and
sparse
meadows
which
made
desperate
effort
every
year
show
little
green
They
very
rarely
succeed
good
show
yellow

The
rugged
summits
the
rocky
hills
were
dimly
visible
the
edge
the
horizon
through
the
misty
fogs
every
now
and
then
some
heavy
flakes
snow
showed
conspicuous
the
morning
light
while
certain
lofty
and
pointed
rocks
were
first
lost
the
grey
low
clouds
their
summits
clearly
visible
above
like
jagged
reefs
rising
from
troublous
sea

Every
now
and
then
spur
rock
came
down
through
the
arid
ground
leaving
scarcely
room
pass
Our
horses
however
appeared
not
only
well
acquainted
with
the
country
but
kind
instinct
knew
which
was
the
best
road
uncle
had
not
even
the
satisfaction
urging
forward
his
steed
whip
spur
voice
was
utterly
useless
show
any
signs
impatience
could
not
help
smiling
see
him
look
big
his
little
horse
his
long
legs
now
and
then
touching
the
ground
made
him
look
like
six-footed
centaur

Good
beast
good
beast
would
cry
assure
you
that
begin
think
animal
more
intelligent
than
Icelandic
horse
Snow
tempest
impracticable
roads
rocks
icebergs—nothing
stops
him
brave
sober
safe
never
makes
false
step
never
glides
slips
from
his
path
dare
say
that
any
river
any
fjord
has
crossed—and
have
doubt
there
will
many—you
will
see
him
enter
the
water
without
hesitation
like
amphibious
animal
and
reach
the
opposite
side
safety
must
not
however
attempt
hurry
him
must
allow
him
have
his
own
way
and
will
undertake
say
that
between
shall
our
ten
leagues
day

may
was
reply
but
what
about
our
worthy
guide

have
not
the
slightest
anxiety
about
him:
that
sort
people
ahead
without
knowing
even
what
they
are
about
Look
Hans
moves
little
that
impossible
for
him
become
fatigued
Besides
were
complain
weariness
could
have
the
loan
horse
should
have
violent
attack
the
cramp
were
not
have
some
sort
exercise
arms
are
right—but
legs
are
getting
little
stiff

All
this
while
were
advancing
rapid
pace
The
country
had
reached
was
already
nearly
desert
Here
and
there
could
seen
isolated
farm
some
solitary
bur
Icelandic
house
built
wood
earth
fragments
lava—looking
like
beggars
the
highway
life
These
wretched
and
miserable
huts
excited
such
pity
that
felt
half
disposed
leave
alms
every
door
this
country
there
are
roads
paths
are
nearly
unknown
and
vegetation
poor
was
slowly
reached
perfection
soon
obliterated
all
traces
the
few
travelers
who
passed
from
place
place

Nevertheless
this
division
the
province
situated
only
few
miles
from
the
capital
considered
one
the
best
cultivated
and
most
thickly
peopled
all
Iceland
What
then
must
the
state
the
less
known
and
more
distant
parts
the
island
After
traveling
fully
half
Danish
mile
had
met
neither
farmer
the
door
his
hut
nor
even
wandering
shepherd
with
his
wild
and
savage
flock

few
stray
cows
and
sheep
were
only
seen
occasionally
What
then
must
expect
when
come
the
upheaved
regions—to
the
districts
broken
and
roughened
from
volcanic
eruptions
and
subterraneous
commotions

were
learn
this
all
good
time
saw
however
consulting
the
map
that
avoided
good
deal
this
rough
country
following
the
winding
and
desolate
shores
the
sea
reality
the
great
volcanic
movement
the
island
and
all
its
attendant
phenomena
are
concentrated
the
interior
the
island
there
horizontal
layers
strata
rocks
piled
one
upon
the
other
eruptions
basaltic
origin
and
streams
lava
have
given
this
country
kind
supernatural
reputation

Little
did
expect
however
the
spectacle
which
awaited
when
reached
the
peninsula
Sneffels
where
agglomerations
nature's
ruins
form
kind
terrible
chaos

Some
two
hours
more
after
had
left
the
city
Reykjavik
reached
the
little
town
called
Aoalkirkja
the
principal
church
consists
simply
few
houses—not
what
England
Germany
should
call
hamlet

Hans
stopped
here
one
half
hour
shared
our
frugal
breakfast
answered
Yes
and
uncle's
questions
the
nature
the
road
and
last
when
asked
where
were
pass
the
night
was
laconic
usual

Gardar
was
his
one-worded
reply

took
occasion
consult
the
map
see
where
Gardar
was
found
After
looking
keenly
found
small
town
that
name
the
borders
the
Hvalfjord
about
four
miles
from
Reykjavik
pointed
this
out
uncle
who
made
very
energetic
grimace

Only
four
miles
out
twenty-two
Why
only
little
walk

was
about
make
some
energetic
observation
the
guide
but
Hans
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
him
went
front
the
horses
and
walked
ahead
with
the
same
imperturbable
phlegm
had
always
exhibited

Three
hours
later
still
traveling
over
those
apparently
interminable
and
sandy
prairies
were
compelled
round
the
Kollafjord
easier
and
shorter
cut
than
crossing
the
gulfs
Shortly
after
entered
place
communal
jurisdiction
called
Ejulberg
and
the
clock
which
would
then
have
struck
twelve
any
Icelandic
church
had
been
rich
enough
possess
valuable
and
useful
article
These
sacred
edifices
are
however
very
much
like
these
people
who
without
watches—and
never
miss
them

Here
the
horses
were
allowed
take
some
rest
and
refreshment
then
following
narrow
strip
shore
between
high
rocks
and
the
sea
they
took
without
further
halt
the
Aoalkirkja
Brantar
and
after
another
mile
Saurboer
Annexia
chapel
ease
situated
the
southern
bank
the
Hvalfjord

was
four
o'clock
the
evening
and
had
traveled
four
Danish
miles
about
equal
twenty
English

The
fjord
was
this
place
about
half
mile
width
The
sweeping
and
broken
waves
came
rolling
upon
the
pointed
rocks
the
gulf
was
surrounded
rocky
walls—a
mighty
cliff
three
thousand
feet
height
remarkable
for
its
brown
strata
separated
here
and
there
beds
tufa
reddish
hue
Now
whatever
may
have
been
the
intelligence
our
horses
had
not
the
slightest
reliance
upon
them
means
crossing
stormy
arm
the
sea
ride
over
salt
water
upon
the
back
little
horse
seemed
absurd

they
are
really
intelligent
said
myself
they
will
certainly
not
make
the
attempt
any
case
shall
trust
rather
own
intelligence
than
theirs

But
uncle
was
humor
wait
dug
his
heels
into
the
sides
his
steed
and
made
for
the
shore
His
horse
went
the
very
edge
the
water
sniffed
the
approaching
wave
and
retreated

uncle
who
was
sooth
say
quite
obstinate
the
beast
bestrode
insisted
his
making
the
desired
advance
This
attempt
was
followed
new
refusal
the
part
the
horse
which
quietly
shook
his
head
This
demonstration
rebellion
was
followed
volley
words
and
stout
application
whipcord
also
followed
kicks
the
part
the
horse
which
threw
its
head
and
heels
upwards
and
tried
throw
his
rider
length
the
sturdy
little
pony
spreading
out
his
legs
stiff
and
ludicrous
attitude
got
from
under
the
Professor's
legs
and
left
him
standing
with
both
feet
separate
stone
like
the
Colossus
Rhodes

Wretched
animal
cried
uncle
suddenly
transformed
into
foot
passenger—and
angry
and
ashamed
dismounted

field

Farja
said
the
guide
tapping
him
familiarly
the
shoulder

What

Der
answered
Hans
pointing
where
lay
the
boat
question—there

Well
cried
quite
delighted
with
the
information
Why
did
you
not
say
before
cried
uncle
why
not
start
once

Tidvatten
said
the
guide

What
does
say
asked
considerably
puzzled
the
delay
and
the
dialogue

says

replied
uncle
translating
the
Danish
word
for
information

course
understand—we
must
wait
till
the
tide
serves

For
bida
asked
uncle

replied
Hans

uncle
frowned
stamped
his
feet
and
then
followed
the
horses
where
the
boat
lay

thoroughly
understood
and
appreciated
the
necessity
for
waiting
before
crossing
the
fjord
for
that
moment
when
the
sea
its
highest
point
state
slack
water
neither
the
ebb
nor
flow
can
then
felt
the
ferry
boat
was
danger
being
carried
out

upon
the
rocky
coast

The
favorable
moment
did
not
come
until
six
o'clock
the
evening
Then
uncle
myself
and
guide
two
boatmen
and
the
four
horses
got
into
very
awkward
flat-bottom
boat
Accustomed

been

sorry

more

Half
hour
later

Icelandic
really
had
idea
that
should
made
comfortable
There
was
one
objection
the
house
and
that
was
the
very
powerful
odor
dried
fish
macerated
meat
and
sour
milk
which
three
fragrances
combined
did
not
all
suit
olfactory
nerves

soon
had
freed
ourselves
from
our
heavy
traveling
costume
the
voice
our
host
was
heard
calling
come
into
the
kitchen
the
only
room
which
the
Icelanders
ever
make
any
fire
matter
how
cold
may
uncle
nothing
loath
hastened
obey
this
hospitable
and
friendly
invitation
followed

The
kitchen

was
made

stone
standing

middle

room

the
fireplace
above
the
roof
was

This
apartment
was
kitchen

and
dining
room
all
one

our
entrance
our
worthy
host
had
not
seen
before
advanced
ceremoniously
uttered
word
which
means
happy
and
then
kissed
both
the
cheek

His
wife
followed
pronounced
the
same
word
with
the
same
ceremonial
then
the
husband
and
wife
placing
their
right
hands
upon
their
hearts
bowed
profoundly

This
excellent
Icelandic
woman
was
the
mother
nineteen
children
who
little
and
big
rolled
crawled
and
walked
about
the
midst
volumes
smoke
arising
from
the
angular
fireplace
the
middle
the
room
Every
now
and
then
could
see
fresh
white
head
and
slightly
melancholy
expression
countenance
peering
through
the
vapor

Both
uncle
and
myself
however
were
very
friendly
with
the
whole
party
and
before
were
aware
there
were
three
four
these
little
ones
our
shoulders
many
our
boxes
and
the
rest
hanging
about
our
legs
Those
who
could
speak
kept
crying
out
saellvertu
every
possible
and
impossible
key
Those
who
did
not
speak
only
made
all
the
more
noise

This
concert
was
interrupted
the
announcement
supper
this
moment
our
worthy
guide
the
eider-duck
hunter
came
after
seeing
the
feeding
and
stabling
the
horses—which
consisted
letting
them
loose
browse
the
stunted
green
the
Icelandic
prairies
There
was
little
for
them
eat
but
moss
and
some
very
dry
and
innutritious
grass
next
day
they
were
ready
before
the
door
some
time
before
were

Welcome
said
Hans

Then
tranquilly
with
the
air
automaton
without
any
more
expression
one
kiss
than
another
embraced
the
host
and
hostess
and
their
nineteen
children

This
ceremony
concluded
the
satisfaction
all
parties
all
sat
down
table
that
twenty-four
somewhat
crowded
Those
who
were
best
off
had
only
two
juveniles
their
knees

soon
however
the
inevitable
soup
was
placed
the
table
the
natural
taciturnity
common
even
Icelandic
babies
prevailed
over
all
else
Our
host
filled
our
plates
with

soon
the
meal
was
over
the
children
disappeared
whilst
the
grown
people
sat
around
the
fireplace
which
was
placed
turf
heather
cow
dung
and
dried
fish-bones
soon
everybody
was
sufficiently
warm
general
dispersion
took
place
all
retiring
their
respective
couches
Our
hostess
offered
pull
off
our
stockings
and
trousers
according
the
custom
the
country
but
graciously
declined
honored
she
left
our
bed
dry
fodder

Next
day
five
the
morning
took
our
leave
these
hospitable
peasants
uncle
had
great
difficulty
making
them
accept
sufficient
and
proper
remuneration

Hans
then
gave
the
signal
start

had
scarcely
got
hundred
yards
from
Gardar
when
the
character
the
country
changed
The
soil
began
marshy
and
boggy
and
less
favorable
progress
the
right
the
range
mountains
was
prolonged
indefinitely
like
great
system
natural
fortifications
which
skirted
the
glacis
met
with
numerous
streams
and
rivulets
which
was
necessary
ford
and
that
without
wetting
our
baggage
advanced
the
deserted
appearance
increased
and
yet
now
and
then
could
see
human
shadows
flitting
the
distance
When
sudden
turn
the
track
brought
within
easy
reach
one
these
specters
felt
sudden
impulse
disgust
the
sight
swollen
head
with
shining
skin
utterly
without
hair
and
whose
repulsive
and
revolting
wounds
could
seen
through
his
rags
The
unhappy
wretches
never
came
forward
beg
the
contrary
they
ran
away
not
quick
however
but
that
Hans
was
able
salute
them
with
the
universal
saellvertu

Spetelsk
said
leper
explained
uncle

The
very
sound
such
word
caused
feeling
repulsion
The
horrible
affliction
known
leprosy
which
has
almost
vanished
before
the
effects
modern
science
common
Iceland
not
contagious
but
hereditary
that
marriage
strictly
prohibited
these
unfortunate
creatures

These
poor
lepers
did
not
tend
enliven
our
journey
the
scene
which
was
inexpressibly
sad
and
lonely
The
very
last
tufts
grassy
vegetation
appeared
die
our
feet
Not
tree
was
seen
except
few
stunted
willows
about
big
blackberry
bushes
Now
and
then
watched

grey
and

his
flight

and

not

came

gulf
The
tide
was
its
height
and
were
able
over
once
and
reach
the
hamlet
Alftanes
about
mile
farther

That
evening
after
fording
the
Alfa
and
the
Heta
two
rivers
rich
trout
and
pike
were
compelled
pass
the
night
deserted
house
worthy

haunted
all
the
fays
Scandinavian
mythology
The
King
Cold
had
taken
his
residence
there
and
made
feel
his
presence
all
night

The
following
day
was
remarkable
its
lack
any
particular
incidents
Always
the
same
damp
and
swampy
soil
the
same
dreary
uniformity
the
same
sad
and
monotonous
aspect
scenery
the
evening
having
accomplished
the
half
our
projected
journey
slept
the
Annexia
Krosolbt

For
whole
mile
had
under
our
feet
nothing
but
lava
This
disposition
the
soil
called
hraun:
the
crumbled
lava
the
surface
was
some
instances
like
ship
cables
stretched
out
horizontally
others
coiled
heaps
immense
field
lava
came
from
the
neighboring
mountains
all
extinct
volcanoes
but
whose
remains
showed
what
once
they
had
been
Here
and
there

There
was

however

Soon
the
soft
and
swampy
soil
again
appeared
under
the
feet
our
horses
while
every
hundred
yards
came
upon
one
more
small
lakes
Our
journey
was
now
westerly
direction
had
fact
swept
round
the
great
bay
Faxa
and
the
twin
white
summits
Sneffels
rose
the
clouds
distance
less
than
five
miles

The
horses
now
advanced
rapidly
The
accidents
and
difficulties
the
soil
longer
checked
them
confess
that
fatigue
began
tell
severely
upon
but
uncle
was
firm
and
hard
had
been
the
first
day
could
not
help
admiring
both
the
excellent
Professor
and
the
worthy
guide
for
they
appeared
regard
this
rugged
expedition
mere
walk

Saturday
the
June
six
o'clock
the
evening
reached
Budir
small
town
picturesquely
situated
the
shore
the
ocean
and
here
the
guide
asked
for
his
money
uncle
settled
with
him
immediately
was
now
the
family
Hans
himself
that
say
his
uncles
his
cousins—german
who
offered
hospitality
were
exceedingly
well
received
and
without
taking
too
much
advantage
the
goodness
these
worthy
people
should
have
liked
very
much
have
rested
with
them
after
the
fatigues
the
journey
But
uncle
who
did
not
require
rest
had
idea
anything
the
kind
and
despite
the
fact
that
next
day
was
Sunday
was
compelled
once
more
mount
steed

The
soil
was
again
affected
the
neighborhood
the
mountains
whose
granite
peered
out
the
ground
like
tops
old
oak
were
skirting
the
enormous
base
the
mighty
volcano
uncle
never
took
his
eyes
from
off
could
not
keep
from
gesticulating
and
looking
with
kind
sullen
defiance
much
say
That
the
giant
have
made
mind
conquer

After
four
hours
steady
traveling
the
horses
stopped
themselves
before
the
door
the
presbytery
Stapi

CHAPTER
REACH
MOUNT
SNEFFELS—THE
REYKIR

Stapi
town
consisting
thirty
huts
built
large
plain
lava
exposed
the
rays
the
sun
reflected
from
the
volcano
stretches
its
humble
tenements
along
the
end
little
fjord
surrounded
basaltic
wall
the
most
singular
character

Basalt
brown
rock
igneous
origin
assumes
regular
forms
which
astonish
their
singular
appearance
Here
found
Nature
proceeding
geometrically
and
working
quite
after
human
fashion
she
had
employed
the
plummet
line
the
compass
and
the
rule
elsewhere
she
produces
grand
artistic
effects
piling
huge
masses
without
order
connection—if
elsewhere
see
truncated
cones
imperfect
pyramids
with
odd
succession
lines
here
wishing
give
lesson
regularity
and
preceding
the
architects
the
early
ages
she
has
erected
severe
order
architecture
which
neither
the
splendors
Babylon
nor
the
marvels
Greece
ever
surpassed

had
often
heard
the
Giant's
Causeway
Ireland
and
Fingal's
Cave
one
the
Hebrides
but
the
grand
spectacle
real
basaltic
formation
had
never
yet
come
before
eyes

This
Stapi
gave
idea
one
all
its
wonderful
beauty
and
grace

The
wall
the
fjord
like
nearly
the
whole
the
peninsula
consisted
series
vertical
columns
height
about
thirty
feet
These
upright
pillars
stone
the
finest
proportions
supported
archivault
horizontal
columns
which
formed
kind
half-vaulted
roof
above
the
sea
certain
intervals
and
below
this
natural
basin
the
eye
was
pleased
and
surprised
the
sight
oval
openings
through
which
the
outward
waves
came
thundering
volleys
foam
Some
banks
basalt
torn
from
their
fastenings
the
fury
the
waves
lay
scattered
the
ground
like
the
ruins
ancient
temple—ruins
eternally
young
over
which
the
storms
ages
swept
without
producing
any
perceptible
effect

This
was
the
last
stage
our
journey
Hans
had
brought
along
with
fidelity
and
intelligence
and
began
feel
somewhat
more
comfortable
when
reflected
that
was
accompany
still
farther
our
way

When
halted
before
the
house
the
Rector
small
and
incommodious
cabin
neither
handsome
nor
more
comfortable
than
those
his
neighbors
saw
man
the
act
shoeing
horse
hammer
his
hand
and
leathern
apron
tied
round
his
waist

happy
said
the
eider-down
hunter
using
his
national
salutation
his
own
language

God
dag—good
day
replied
the
former
excellent
Danish

Kyrkoherde
cried
Hans
turning
round
and
introducing
him
uncle

The
Rector
repeated
the
worthy
Professor
appears
dear
Harry
that
this
worthy
man
the
Rector
and
not
above
doing
his
own
work

During
the
speaking
these
words
the
guide
intimated
the
Kyrkoherde
what
was
the
true
state
the
case
The
good
man
ceasing
from
his
occupation
gave
kind
halloo
upon
which
tall
woman
almost
giantess
came
out
the
hut
She
was
least
six
feet
high
which
that
region
something
considerable

first
impression
was
one
horror
thought
she
had
come
give
the
Icelandic
kiss
had
however
nothing
fear
for
she
did
not
even
show
much
inclination
receive
into
her
house

The
room
devoted
strangers
appeared
far
the
worst
the
presbytery
was
narrow
dirty
and
offensive
There
was
however
choice
about
the
matter
The
Rector
had
notion
practicing
the
usual
cordial
and
antique
hospitality
Far
from
Before
the
day
was
over
found
had
deal
with
blacksmith
fisherman
hunter
carpenter
anything
but
clergyman
must
said
his
favor
that
had
caught
him
weekday
probably
appeared
greater
advantage
the
Sunday

These
poor
priests
receive
from
the
Danish
Government
most
ridiculously
inadequate
salary
and
collect
one
quarter
the
tithe
their
parish—not
more
than
sixty
marks
current
about
sterling
Hence
the
necessity
working
live
truth
soon
found
that
our
host
did
not
count
civility
among
the
cardinal
virtues

uncle
soon
became
aware
the
kind
man
had
deal
with
Instead
worthy
and
learned
scholar
found
dull
ill-mannered
peasant
therefore
resolved
start
his
great
expedition
soon
possible
did
not
care
about
fatigue
and
resolved
spend
few
days
the
mountains

The
preparations
for
our
departure
were
made
the
very
next
day
after
our
arrival
Stapi
Hans
now
hired
three
Icelanders
take
the
place
the
horses—which
could
longer
carry
our
luggage
When
however
these
worthy
islanders
had
reached
the
bottom
the
crater
they
were
back
and
leave
ourselves
This
point
was
settled
before
they
would
agree
start

this
occasion
uncle
partly
confided
Hans
the
eider-duck
hunter
and
gave
him
understand
that
was
his
intention
continue
his
exploration
the
volcano
the
last
possible
limits

Hans
listened
calmly
and
then
nodded
his
head
there
elsewhere
bury
himself
the
bowels
the
earth
travel
over
its
summits
was
all
the
same
him
for
amused
and
occupied
the
incidents
travel
had
begun
forget
the
inevitable
future
but
now
was
once
more
destined
realize
the
actual
state
affairs
What
was
done
Run
away
But
really
had
intended
leave
Professor
Hardwigg
his
fate
should
have
been
Hamburg
and
not
the
foot
Sneffels

One
idea
above
all
others
began
trouble
me:
very
terrible
idea
and
one
calculated
shake
the
nerves
man
even
less
sensitive
than
myself

Let
consider
the
matter
said
myself
are
going
ascend
the
Sneffels
mountain
Well
and
good
are
about
pay
visit
the
very
bottom
the
crater
Good
still
Others
have
done
and
did
not
perish
from
that
course

That
however
not
the
whole
matter
considered
road
does
really
present
itself
which
descend
into
the
dark
and
subterraneous
bowels
Mother
Earth
this
thrice
unhappy
Saknussemm
has
really
told
the
truth
shall
most
certainly
lost
the
midst
the
labyrinth
subterraneous
galleries
the
volcano
Now
have
evidence
prove
that
Sneffels
really
extinct
What
proof
have
that
eruption
not
shortly
about
take
place
Because
the
monster
has
slept
soundly
since
does
follow
that
never
wake

does
wake
what
become
These
were
questions
worth
thinking
about
and
upon
them
reflected
long
and
deeply
could
not
lie
down
search
sleep
without
dreaming
eruptions
The
more
thought
the
more
objected
reduced
the
state
dross
and
ashes

could
stand
longer
determined
last
submit
the
whole
case
uncle
the
most
adroit
manner
possible
and
under
the
form
some
totally
irreconcilable
hypothesis

sought
him
laid
before
him
fears
and
then
drew
back
order
let
him
get
his
passion
over
his
ease

have
been
thinking
about
the
matter
said
the
quietest
tone
the
world

What
did
mean
Was
last
about
listen
the
voice
reason
Did
think
suspending
his
projects
was
almost
too
much
happiness
true

however
made
remark
fact
was
only
too
anxious
not
interrupt
him
and
allowed
him
reflect
his
leisure
After
some
moments
spoke
out

have
been
thinking
about
the
matter
resumed
Ever
since
have
been
Stapi
mind
has
been
almost
solely
occupied
with
the
grave
question
which
has
been
submitted
yourself—for
nothing
would
unwiser
and
more
inconsistent
than
act
with
imprudence

heartily
agree
with
you
dear
uncle
was
somewhat
hopeful
rejoinder

now
six
hundred
years
since
Sneffels
has
spoken
but
though
now
reduced
state
utter
silence
may
speak
again
New
volcanic
eruptions
are
always
preceded
perfectly
well-known
phenomena
have
closely
examined
the
inhabitants
this
region
have
carefully
studied
the
soil
and
beg
tell
you
emphatically
dear
Harry
there
will
eruption
present

listened
his
positive
affirmations
was
stupefied
and
could
say
nothing

see
you
doubt
word
said
uncle
follow
obeyed
mechanically

Leaving
the
presbytery
the
Professor
took
road
through
opening
the
basaltic
rock
which
led
far
away
from
the
sea
were
soon
open
country
could
give
such
name
place
all
covered
with
volcanic
deposits
The
whole
land
seemed
crushed
under
the
weight
enormous
stones—of
trap
basalt
granite
lava
and
all
other
volcanic
substances

could
see
many
spouts
steam
rising
the
air
These
white
vapors
called
the
Icelandic
language
reykir
come
from
hot
water
fountains
and
indicate
their
violence
the
volcanic
activity
the
soil
Now
the
sight
these
appeared
justify
apprehension
was
therefore
all
the
more
surprised
and
mortified
when
uncle
thus
addressed
You
see
all
this
smoke
Harry
boy

Yes
sir

Well
long
you
see
them
thus
you
have
nothing
fear
from
the
volcano

How
can
that
careful
remember
this
continued
the
Professor
the
approach
eruption
these
spouts
vapor
redouble
their
activity—to
disappear
altogether
during
the
period
volcanic
eruption
for
the
elastic
fluids
longer
having
the
necessary
tension
seek
refuge
the
interior
the
crater
instead
escaping
through
the
fissures
the
earth
then
the
steam
remains
its
normal
habitual
state
their
energy
does
not
increase
and
you
add
this
the
remark
that
the
wind
not
replaced
heavy
atmospheric
pressure
and
dead
calm
you
may
quite
sure
that
there
fear
any
immediate
eruption

But—

Enough
boy
When
science
has
sent
forth
her
fiat—it
only
hear
and
obey

came
back
the
house
quite
downcast
and
disappointed
uncle
had
completely
defeated
with
his
scientific
arguments
Nevertheless
had
still
one
hope
and
that
was
when
once
were
the
bottom
the
crater
that
would
impossible
default
gallery
tunnel
descend
any
deeper
and
this
despite
all
the
learned
Saknussemms
the
world

passed
the
whole
the
following
night
with
nightmare
chest
and
after
unheard-of
miseries
and
tortures
found
myself
the
very
depths
the
earth
from
which
was
suddenly
launched
into
planetary
space
under
the
form
eruptive
rock

Next
day
June
Hans
calmly
awaited
outside
the
presbytery
with
his
three
companions
loaded
with
provisions
tools
and
instruments
Two
iron-shod
poles
two
guns
and
two
large
game
bags
were
reserved
for
uncle
and
myself
Hans
who
was
man
who
never
forgot
even
the
minutest
precautions
had
added
our
baggage
large
skin
full
water
addition
our
gourds
This
assured
water
for
eight
days

was
nine
o'clock
the
morning
when
were
quite
ready
The
rector
and
his
huge
wife
servant
never
knew
which
stood
the
door
see
off
They
appeared
about
inflict
the
usual
final
kiss
the
Icelanders
our
supreme
astonishment
their
adieu
took
the
shape
formidable
bill
which
they
even
counted
the
use
the
pastoral
house
really
and
truly
the
most
abominable
and
dirty
place
ever
was
The
worthy
couple
cheated
and
robbed
like
Swiss
innkeeper
and
made
feel
the
sum
had
pay
the
splendors
their
hospitality

uncle
however
paid
without
bargaining
man
who
had
made
his
mind
undertake
voyage
into
the
Interior
the
Earth
not
the
man
haggle
over
few
miserable
rix-dollars

This
important
matter
settled
Hans
gave
the
signal
for
departure
and
some
few
moments
later
had
left
Stapi

CHAPTER
THE
ASCENT
MOUNT
SNEFFELS

The
huge
volcano
which
was
the
first
stage
our
daring
experiment
above
five
thousand
feet
high
Sneffels
the
termination
long
range
volcanic
mountains
different
character
the
system
the
island
itself
One
its
peculiarities
its
two
huge
pointed
summits
From
whence
started
was
impossible
make
out
the
real
outlines
the
peak
against
the
grey
field
sky
All
could
distinguish
was
vast
dome
white
which
fell
downwards
from
the
head
the
giant

The
commencement
the
great
undertaking
filled
with
awe
Now
that
had
actually
started
began
believe
the
reality
the
undertaking

Our
party
formed
quite
procession
walked
single
file
preceded
Hans
the
imperturbable
eider-duck
hunter
calmly
led
narrow
paths
where
two
persons
could
possibility
walk
abreast
Conversation
was
wholly
impossible
had
all
the
more
opportunity
reflect
and
admire
the
awful
grandeur
the
scene
around

Beyond
the
extraordinary
basaltic
wall
the
fjord
Stapi
found
ourselves
making
our
way
through
fibrous
turf
over
which
grew
scanty
vegetation
grass
the
residuum
the
ancient
vegetation
the
swampy
peninsula
The
vast
mass
this
combustible
the
field
which
yet
utterly
unexplored
would
suffice
warm
Iceland
for
whole
century
This
mighty
turf
pit
measured
from
the
bottom
certain
ravines
often
not
less
than
seventy
feet
deep
and
presents
the
eye
the
view
successive
layers
black
burned-up
rocky
detritus
separated
thin
streaks
porous
sandstone

The
grandeur
the
spectacle
was
undoubted
well
its
arid
and
deserted
air

true
nephew
the
great
Professor
Hardwigg
and
despite
preoccupation
and
doleful
fears
what
was
come
observed
with
great
interest
the
vast
collection
mineralogical
curiosities
spread
out
before
this
vast
museum
natural
history
Looking
back
recent
studies
went
over
thought
the
whole
geological
history
Iceland

This
extraordinary
and
curious
island
must
have
made
its
appearance
from
out
the
great
world
waters
comparatively
recent
date
Like
the
coral
islands
the
Pacific
may
for
aught
know
still
rising
slow
and
imperceptible
degrees

this
really
the
case
its
origin
can
attributed
only
one
cause—that
the
continued
action
subterranean
fires

This
was
happy
thought

this
were
true
away
with
the
theories
Sir
Humphry
Davy
away
with
the
authority
the
parchment
Arne
Saknussemm
the
wonderful
pretensions
discovery
the
part
uncle—and
our
journey

All
must
end
smoke

Charmed
with
the
idea
began
more
carefully
look
about
serious
study
the
soil
was
necessary
negative
confirm
hypothesis
took
every
item
what
saw
and
began
comprehend
the
succession
phenomena
which
had
preceded
its
formation

Iceland
being
absolutely
without
sedimentary
soil
composed
exclusively
volcanic
tufa
that
say
agglomeration
stones
and
rocks
porous
texture
Long
before
the
existence
volcanoes
was
composed
solid
body
massive
trap
rock
lifted
bodily
and
slowly
out
the
sea
the
action
the
centrifugal
force
work
the
earth

The
internal
fires
however
had
not
yet
burst
their
bounds
and
flooded
the
exterior
cake
Mother
Earth
with
hot
and
raging
lava

readers
must
excuse
this
brief
and
somewhat
pedantic
geological
lecture
But
necessary
the
complete
understanding
what
follows

later
period
the
world's
history
huge
and
mighty
fissure
must
reasoning
analogy
have
been
dug
diagonally
from
the
southwest
the
northeast
the
island
through
which
degrees
flowed
the
volcanic
crust
The
great
and
wondrous
phenomenon
then
went
without
violence—the
outpouring
was
enormous
and
the
seething
fused
matter
ejected
from
the
bowels
the
earth
spread
slowly
and
peacefully
the
form
vast
level
plains
what
are
called
mamelons
mounds

was
this
epoch
that
the
rocks
called
feldspars
syenites
and
porphyries
appeared

But
natural
consequence
this
overflow
the
depth
the
island
increased
can
readily
believed
what
enormous
quantity
elastic
fluids
were
piled
within
its
centre
when
last
afforded
other
openings
after
the
process
cooling
the
crust
had
taken
place

length
time
came
when
despite
the
enormous
thickness
and
weight
the
upper
crust
the
mechanical
forces
the
combustible
gases
below
became
great
that
they
actually
upheaved
the
weighty
back
and
made
for
themselves
huge
and
gigantic
shafts
Hence
the
volcanoes
which
suddenly
arose
through
the
upper
crust
and
next
the
craters
which
burst
forth
the
summit
these
new
creations

will
seen
that
the
first
phenomena
connection
with
the
formation
the
island
were
simply
eruptive
these
however
shortly
succeeded
the
volcanic
phenomena

Through
the
newly
formed
openings
escaped
the
marvelous
mass
basaltic
stones
with
which
the
plain
were
now
crossing
was
covered
were
trampling
our
way
over
heavy
rocks
dark
grey
color
which
while
cooling
had
been
moulded
into
six-sided
prisms
the
back
distance
could
see
number
flattened
cones
which
formerly
were
many
fire-vomiting
mouths

After
the
basaltic
eruption
was
appeased
and
set
rest
the
volcano
the
force
which
increased
with
that
the

gave

fiery

and

and
pumice

now
scattered
over
the
sides
the
mountain
like
disheveled
hair

shoulders
Bacchante

Here
nutshell
had
the
whole
history
the
phenomena
from
which
Iceland
arose
All

interior

and
believe
that
the

not

simply
and
purely
madness

This
being
satisfactorily
proved
QED
what
insensate
folly
pretend

into
the
interior
the
mighty
earth

This
mental
lecture
delivered
myself
while
proceeding
journey
did
good
was
quite
reassured
the
fate
our
enterprise
and
therefore
went
like
brave
soldier
mounting
bristling
battery
the
assault
old
Sneffels

advanced
the
road
became
every
moment
more
difficult
The
soil
was
broken
and
dangerous
The
rocks
broke
and
gave
way
under
our
feet
and
had
scrupulously
careful
order
avoid
dangerous
and
constant
falls

Hans
advanced
calmly
had
been
walking
over
Salisbury
Plain
sometimes
would
disappear
behind
huge
blocks
stone
and
momentarily
lost
sight
him
There
was
little
period
anxiety
and
then
there
was
shrill
whistle
just
tell
where
look
for
him

Occasionally
would
take
into
his
head
stop
pick
lumps
rock
and
silently
pile
them
into
small
heaps
order
that
might
not
lose
our
way
our
return

had
idea
the
journey
were
about
undertake

all
events
the
precaution
was
good
one
though
how
utterly
useless
and
unnecessary—but
must
not
anticipate

Three
hours
terrible
fatigue
walking
incessantly
had
only
brought
the
foot
the
great
mountain
This
will
give
some
notion
what
had
still
undergo

Suddenly
however
Hans
cried
halt—that
made
signs
that
effect—and
summary
kind
breakfast
was
laid
out
the
lava
before
uncle
who
now
was
simply
Professor
Hardwigg
was
eager
advance
that
bolted
his
food
like
greedy
clown
This
halt
for
refreshment
was
also
halt
for
repose
The
Professor
was
therefore
compelled
wait
the
good
pleasure
his
imperturbable
guide
who
did
not
give
the
signal
for
departure
for
good
hour

The
three
Icelanders
who
were
taciturn
their
comrade
did
not
say
word
but
went
eating
and
drinking
very
quietly
and
soberly

From
this
our
first
real
stage
began
ascend
the
slopes
the
Sneffels
volcano
Its
magnificent
snowy
nightcap
began
call
optical
delusion
very
common
mountains
appeared
close
hand
and
yet
how
many
long
weary
hours
must
elapse
before
reached
its
summit
What
unheard-of
fatigue
must
endure

The
stones
the
mountain
side
held
together
cement
soil
bound
together
roots
creeping
herbs
gave
way
continually
under
our
feet
and
went
rushing
below
into
the
plains
like
series
small
avalanches

certain
places
the
sides
this
stupendous
mountain
were
angle
steep
that
was
impossible
climb
upwards
and
were
compelled
get
round
these
obstacles
best
might

Those
who
understand
Alpine
climbing
will
comprehend
our
difficulties
Often
were
obliged
help
each
other
along
means
our
climbing
poles

must
say
this
for
uncle
that
stuck
close
possible
never
lost
sight
and
many
occasions
his
arm
supplied
with
firm
and
solid
support
was
strong
wiry
and
apparently
insensible
fatigue
Another
great
advantage
with
him
was
that
had
the
innate
sentiment
equilibrium—for
never
slipped
failed
his
steps
The
Icelanders
though
heavily
loaded
climbed
with
the
agility
mountaineers

Looking
every
now
and
then
the
height
the
great
volcano
Sneffels
appeared
wholly
impossible
reach
the
summit
that
side
all
events
the
angle
inclination
did
not
speedily
change

Fortunately
after
hour
unheard-of
fatigues
and
gymnastic
exercises
that
would
have
been
trying
acrobat
came
vast
field
ice
which
wholly
surrounded
the
bottom
the
cone
the
volcano
The
natives
called
the
tablecloth
probably
from
some
such
reason
the
dwellers
the
Cape
Good
Hope
call
their
mountain
Table
Mountain
and
their
roads
Table
Bay

Here
our
mutual
surprise
found
actual
flight
stone
steps
which
wonderfully
assisted
our
ascent
This
singular
flight
stairs
was
like
everything
else
volcanic
had
been
formed
one
those
torrents
stones
cast
the
eruptions
and
which
the
Icelandic
name
stina
this
singular
torrent
had
not
been
checked
its
descent
the
peculiar
shape
the
flanks
the
mountain
would
have
swept
into
the
sea
and
would
have
formed
new
islands

Such
was
served
admirably
The
abrupt
character
the
slopes
momentarily
increased
but
these
remarkable
stone
steps
little
less
difficult
than
those
the
Egyptian
pyramids
were
the
one
simple
natural
means
which
were
enabled
proceed

About
seven
the
evening
that
day
after
having
clambered
two
thousand
these
rough
steps
found
ourselves
overlooking
kind
spur
projection
the
mountain—a
sort
buttress
upon
which
the
conelike
crater
properly
called
leaned
for
support

The
ocean
lay
beneath
depth
more
than
three
thousand
two
hundred
feet—a
grand
and
mighty
spectacle
had
reached
the
region
eternal
snows

The
cold
was
keen
searching
and
intense
The
wind
blew
with
extraordinary
violence
was
utterly
exhausted

worthy
uncle
the
Professor
saw
clearly
that
legs
refused
further
service
and
that
fact
was
utterly
exhausted
Despite
his
hot
and
feverish
impatience
decided
with
sigh
upon
halt
called
the
eider-duck
hunter
his
side
That
worthy
however
shook
his
head

Ofvanfor
was
his
sole
spoken
reply

appears
says
uncle
with
woebegone
look
that
must
higher

then
turned
Hans
and
asked
him
give
some
reason
for
this
decisive
response

Mistour
replied
the
guide

mistour—yes
the
mistour
cried
one
the
Icelandic
guides
terrified
tone

was
the
first
time
had
spoken

What
does
this
mysterious
word
signify
anxiously
inquired

Look
said
uncle

looked
down
upon
the
plain
below
and
saw
vast
prodigious
volume
pulverized
pumice
stone
sand
dust
rising
the
heavens
the
form
mighty
waterspout
resembled
the
fearful
phenomenon
similar
character
known
the
travelers
the
desert
the
great
Sahara

The
wind
was
driving
directly
towards
that
side
Sneffels
which
were
perched
This
opaque
veil
standing
between
and
the
sun
projected
deep
shadow
the
flanks
the
mountain
this
sand
spout
broke
over
must
all
infallibly
destroyed
crushed
its
fearful
embraces
This
extraordinary
phenomenon
very
common
when
the
wind
shakes
the
glaciers
and
sweeps
over
the
arid
plains
the
Icelandic
tongue
called
mistour

Hastigt
hastigt
cried
our
guide

Now
certainly
knew
nothing
Danish
but
thoroughly
understood
that
his
gestures
were
meant
quicken
The
guide
turned
rapidly
direction
which
would
take
the
back
the
crater
all
the
while
ascending
slightly

followed
rapidly
despite
our
excessive
fatigue

quarter
hour
later
Hans
paused
enable
look
back
The
mighty
whirlwind
sand
was
spreading
the
slope
the
mountain
the
very
spot
where
had
proposed
halt
Huge
stones
were
caught
cast
into
the
air
and
thrown
about
during
eruption
were
happily
little
out
the
direction
the
wind
and
therefore
out
reach
danger
But
for
the
precaution
and
knowledge
our
guide
our
dislocated
bodies
our
crushed
and
broken
limbs
would
have
been
cast
the
wind
like
dust
from
some
unknown
meteor

Hans
however
did
not
think
prudent
pass
the
night
the
bare
side
the
cone
therefore
continued
our
journey
zigzag
direction
The
fifteen
hundred
feet
which
remained
accomplished
took
least
five
hours
The
turnings
and
windings
the
no-thoroughfares
the
marches
and
marches
turned
that
insignificant
distance
into
least
three
leagues
never
felt
such
misery
fatigue
and
exhaustion
life
was
ready
faint
from
hunger
and
cold
The
rarefied
air
the
same
time
painfully
acted
upon
lungs

last
when
thought
myself
last
gasp
about
eleven
night
being
that
region
quite
dark
reached
the
summit
Mount
Sneffels
was
awful
mood
mind
that
despite
fatigue
before
descended
into
the
crater
which
was
shelter
for
the
night
paused
behold
the
sun
rise
midnight
the
very
day
its
lowest
declension
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
its
ghastly
pale
rays
cast
upon
the
isle
which
lay
sleeping
our
feet

longer
wondered
people
traveling
all
the
way
from
England
Norway
behold
this
magical
and
wondrous
spectacle

CHAPTER
THE
SHADOW
SCARTARIS

Our
supper
was
eaten
with
ease
and
rapidity
after
which
everybody
did
the
best
could
for
himself
within
the
hollow
the
crater
The
bed
was
hard
the
shelter
unsatisfactory
the
situation
painful—lying
the
open
air
five
thousand
feet
above
the
level
the
sea

Nevertheless
has
seldom
happened
sleep
well
did
that
particular
night
did
not
even
dream
much
for
the
effects
what
uncle
called
wholesome
fatigue

Next
day
when
awoke
under
the
rays
bright
and
glorious
sun
were
nearly
frozen
the
keen
air
left
granite
couch
and
made
one
the
party
enjoy
view
the
magnificent
spectacle
which
developed
itself
panorama-like
our
feet

stood
upon
the
lofty
summit
Mount
Sneffels'
southern
peak
Thence
was
able
obtain
view
the
greater
part
the
island
The
optical
delusion
common
all
lofty
heights
raised
the
shores
the
island
while
the
central
portions
appeared
depressed
was
means
too
great
flight
fancy
believe
that
giant
picture
was
stretched
out
before
could
see
the
deep
valleys
that
crossed
each
other
every
direction
could
see
precipices
looking
like
sides
wells
lakes
that
seemed
changed
into
ponds
ponds
that
looked
like
puddles
and
rivers
that
were
transformed
into
petty
brooks
right
were
glaciers
upon
glaciers
and
multiplied
peaks
topped
with
light
clouds
smoke

The
undulation
these
infinite
numbers
mountains
whose
snowy
summits
make
them
look
covered
foam
recalled
remembrance
the
surface
storm-beaten
ocean
looked
towards
the
west
the
ocean
lay
before
all
its
majestic
grandeur
continuation
were
these
fleecy
hilltops

Where
the
earth
ended
and
the
sea
began
was
impossible
for
the
eye
distinguish

soon
felt
that
strange
and
mysterious
sensation
which
awakened
the
mind
when
looking
down
from
lofty
hilltops
and
now
was
able
without
any
feeling
nervousness
having
fortunately
hardened
myself
that
kind
sublime
contemplation

wholly
forgot
who
was
and
where
was
became
intoxicated
with
sense
lofty
sublimity
without
thought
the
abysses
into
which
daring
was
soon
about
plunge
was
presently
however
brought
back
the
realities
life
the
arrival
the
Professor
and
Hans
who
joined
upon
the
lofty
summit
the
peak

uncle
turning
westerly
direction
pointed
out
light
cloud
vapor
kind
haze
with
faint
outline
land
rising
out
the
waters

Greenland
said
Greenland
cried
reply

Yes
continued
uncle
who
always
when
explaining
anything
spoke
were
professor's
chair
are
not
more
than
thirty-five
leagues
distant
from
that
wonderful
land
When
the
great
annual
breakup
the
ice
takes
place
white
bears
come
over
Iceland
carried
the
floating
masses
ice
from
the
north
This
however
matter
little
consequence
are
now
the
summit
the
great
the
transcendent
Sneffels
and
here
are
its
two
peaks
north
and
south
Hans
will
tell
you
the
name
which
the
people
Iceland
call
that
which
stand

uncle
turned
the
imperturbable
guide
who
nodded
and
spoke
usual—one
word

Scartaris

uncle
looked
with
proud
and
triumphant
glance

crater
said
you
hear

did
hear
but
was
totally
unable
make
reply

The
crater
Mount
Sneffels
represented
inverted
cone
the
gaping
orifice
apparently
half
mile
across
the
depth
indefinite
feet
Conceive
what
this
hole
must
have
been
like
when
full
flame
and
thunder
and
lightning
The
bottom
the
funnel-shaped
hollow
was
about
five
hundred
feet
circumference
which
will
seen
that
the
slope
from
the
summit
the
bottom
was
very
gradual
and
were
therefore
clearly
able
get
there
without
much
fatigue
difficulty
Involuntarily
compared
this
crater
enormous
loaded
cannon
and
the
comparison
completely
terrified
descend
into
the
interior
cannon
thought
myself
when
perhaps
loaded
and
will
off
the
least
shock
the
act
madman

But
there
was
longer
any
opportunity
for
hesitate
Hans
with
perfectly
calm
and
indifferent
air
took
his
usual
post
the
head
the
adventurous
little
band
followed
without
uttering
syllable

felt
like
the
lamb
led
the
slaughter

order
render
the
descent
less
difficult
Hans
took
his
way
down
the
interior
the
cone
rather
zigzag
fashion
making
the
sailors
say
long
tracks
the
eastward
followed
equally
long
ones
the
west
was
necessary
walk
through
the
midst
eruptive
rocks
some
which
shaken
their
balance
went
rolling
down
with
thundering
clamor
the
bottom
the
abyss
These
continual
falls
awoke
echoes
singular
power
and
effect

Many
portions
the
cone
consisted
inferior
glaciers
Hans
whenever
met
with
one
these
obstacles
advanced
with
great
show
precaution
sounding
the
soil
with
his
long
iron
pole
order
discover
fissures
and
layers
deep
soft
snow
many
doubtful
dangerous
places
became
necessary
for
tied
together
long
rope
order
that
should
any
one
unfortunate
enough
slip
would
supported
his
companions
This
connecting
link
was
doubtless
prudent
precaution
but
not
any
means
unattended
with
danger

Nevertheless
and
despite
all
the
manifold
difficulties
the
descent
along
slopes
with
which
our
guide
was
wholly
unacquainted
made
considerable
progress
without
accident
One
our
great
parcels
rope
slipped
from
one
the
Iceland
porters
and
rushed
short
cut
the
bottom
the
abyss

midday
were
the
end
our
journey
looked
upwards
and
saw
only
the
upper
orifice
the
cone
which
served
circular
frame
very
small
portion
the
sky—a
portion
which
seemed
singularly
beautiful
Should
ever
again
gaze
that
lovely
sunlit
sky

The
only
exception
this
extraordinary
landscape
was
the
Peak
Scartaris
which
seemed
lost
the
great
void
the
heavens

The
bottom
the
crater
was
composed
three
separate
shafts
through
which
during
periods
eruption
when
Sneffels
was
action
the
great
central
furnace
sent
forth
its
burning
lava
and
poisonous
vapors
Each
these
chimneys
shafts
gaped
open-mouthed
our
path
kept
far
away
from
them
possible
not
even
venturing
take
the
faintest
peep
downwards

for
the
Professor
after
rapid
examination
their
disposition
and
characteristics
became
breathless
and
panting
ran
from
one
the
other
like
delighted
schoolboy
gesticulating
wildly
and
uttering
incomprehensible
and
disjointed
phrases
all
sorts
languages

Hans
the
guide
and
his
humbler
companions
seated
themselves
some
piles
lava
and
looked
silently
They
clearly
took
uncle
for
lunatic
and—waited
the
result

Suddenly
the
Professor
uttered
wild
unearthly
cry
first
imagined
had
lost
his
footing
and
was
falling
headlong
into
one
the
yawning
gulfs
Nothing
the
kind
saw
him
his
arms
spread
out
their
widest
extent
his
legs
stretched
apart
standing
upright
before
enormous
pedestal
high
enough
and
black
enough
bear
gigantic
statue
Pluto
His
attitude
and
mien
were
that
man
utterly
stupefied
But
his
stupefaction
was
speedily
changed
the
wildest
joy

Harry
Harry
come
here
cried
make
haste—wonderful—wonderful

Unable
understand
what
meant
turned
obey
his
commands
Neither
Hans
nor
the
other
Icelanders
moved
step

Look
said
the
Professor
something
the
manner
the
French
general
pointing
out
the
pyramids
his
army

And
fully
partaking
his
stupefaction
not
his
joy
read
the
eastern
side
the
huge
block
stone
the
same
characters
half
eaten
away

corrosive

times

the

What
would

How
long
remained
this
state
know
not
All
can
say
that
when
last
raised
head
from
between
hands
there
remained
the
bottom
the
crater
only
myself
uncle
and
Hans
The
Icelandic
porters
had
been
dismissed
and
were
now
descending
the
exterior
slopes
Mount
Sneffels
their
way
Stapi
How
heartily
did
wish
myself
with
them

Hans
slept
tranquilly
the
foot
rock
kind
rill
lava
where
had
made
himself
rough
and
ready
bed
uncle
was
walking
about
the
bottom
the
crater
like
wild
beast
cage
had
desire
neither
had
the
strength
move
from
recumbent
position
Taking
example
the
guide
gave
way
kind
painful
somnolency
during
which
seemed
both
hear
and
feel
continued
heavings
and
shudderings
the
mountain

this
way
passed
our
first
night
the
interior
crater

Next
morning
grey
cloudy
heavy
sky
hung
like
funereal
pall
over
the
summit
the
volcanic
cone
did
not
notice
much
from
the
obscurity
that
reigned
around
from
the
rage
with
which
uncle
was
devoured

fully
understood

explain
the

yawned
beneath

steps

could
have
been
followed

According

Consequently

discovering
the
right
aperture
had
already
reached
the
June
the
kindly
heavens
would
only
remain
densely
clouded
for
six
more
days
should
have
put
off
our
voyage
discovery
for
another
year
when
certainly
there
would

and

and

the
guide
never
moved
from
his
place
must
have
been
curious
know
what
were
about
indeed
could
believe
were
about
anything
for
uncle
never
addressed
word
was
nursing
his
wrath
keep
warm
His
eyes
fixed
the
black
and
foggy
atmosphere
his
complexion
hideous
with
suppressed
passion
Never
had
his
eyes
appeared
fierce
his
nose
aquiline
his
mouth
hard
and
firm

the
change
for
the
better
mixture
rain
and
snow
fell
during
the
whole
day
Hans
very
quietly
built
himself
hut
lava
into
which
retired
like
Diogenes
into
his
tub
took
malicious
delight
watching
the
thousand
little
cascades
that
flowed
down
the
side
the
cone
carrying
with
them
times
stream
stones
into
the
vasty
deep
below

uncle
was
almost
frantic:
sure
was
enough
make
even
patient
man
angry
had
reached
certain
extent
the
goal
his
desires
and
yet

likely

But
the

and

elements

capable
causing
much
pain
and
sorrow
there
are

sides

And
there

surprise

for

with
sudden

and

there
came

The
sun
poured
its
beaming
rays
the
very
bottom

Each
hillock
every
rock
every
stone
every

the
soil
had
its
share
the
luminous
effulgence
and
its
shadow
fell

CHAPTER
THE
REAL
JOURNEY
COMMENCES

Our
real
journey
had
now
commenced
Hitherto
our
courage
and
determination
had
overcome
all
difficulties
were
fatigued
times
and
that
was
all
Now
were
about
encounter
unknown
and
fearful
dangers

had
not
yet
ventured
take
glimpse
down
the
horrible
abyss
into
which
few
minutes
more
was
about
plunge
The
fatal
moment
had
however
last
arrived
had
still
the
option
refusing
accepting
share
this
foolish
and
audacious
enterprise
But
was
ashamed
show
more
fear
than
the
eider-duck
hunter
Hans
seemed
accept
the
difficulties
the
journey
tranquilly
with
such
calm
indifference
with
such
perfect
recklessness
all
danger
that
actually
blushed
appear
less
man
than
Had
been
alone
with
uncle
should
certainly
have
sat
down
and
argued
the
point
fully
but
the
presence
the
guide
held
tongue
gave
one
moment
the
thought
charming
cousin
and
then
advanced
the
mouth
the
central
shaft

measured
about
hundred
feet
diameter
which
made
about
three
hundred
circumference
leaned
over
rock
which
stood
its
edge
and
looked
down
hair
stood
end
teeth
chattered
limbs
trembled
seemed
utterly
lose
centre
gravity
while
head
was
sort
whirl
like
that
drunken
man
There
nothing
more
powerful
than
this
attraction
towards
abyss
was
about
fall
headlong
into
the
gaping
well
when
was
drawn
back
firm
and
powerful
hand
was
that
Hans
had
not
taken
lessons
enough
the
Frelser's-Kirk
Copenhagen
the
art
looking
down
from
lofty
eminences
without
blinking

However
few
the
minutes
were
during
which
gazed
down
this
tremendous
and
even
wondrous
shaft
had
sufficient
glimpse
give
some
idea
its
physical
conformation
Its
sides
which
were
almost
perpendicular
those
well
presented
numerous
projections
which
doubtless
would
assist
our
descent

was
sort
wild
and
savage
staircase
without
bannister
fence
rope
fastened
above
near
the
surface
would
certainly
support
our
weight
and
enable
reach
the
bottom
but
how
when
had
arrived
its
utmost
depth
were
loosen
above
This
was
thought
question
some
importance

uncle
however
was
one
those
men
who
are
nearly
always
prepared
with
expedients
hit
upon
very
simple
method
obviating
this
difficulty
unrolled
cord
about
thick
thumb
and
least
four
hundred
feet
length
allowed
about
half
down
the
pit
and
catch
hitch
over
great
block
lava
which
stood
the
edge
the
precipice
This
done
threw
the
second
half
after
the
first

Each
could
now
descend
catching
the
two
cords
one
hand
When
about
two
hundred
feet
below
all
the
explorer
had
was
let
one
end
and
pull
away
the
other
when
the
cord
would
come
falling
his
feet
order
down
farther
all
that
was
necessary
was
continue
the
same
operation

This
was
very
excellent
proposition
and
doubt
correct
one
Going
down
appeared
easy
enough
was
the
coming
again
that
now
occupied
thoughts

Now
said
uncle
soon
had
completed
this
important
preparation
let
see
about
the
baggage
must
divided
into
three
separate
parcels
and
each
must
carry
one
his
back
allude
the
more
important
and
fragile
articles

worthy
and
ingenious
uncle
did
not
appear
consider
that
came
under
the
denomination

Hans
continued
you
will
take
charge
the
tools
and
some
the
provisions
you
Harry
must
take
possession
another
third
the
provisions
and
the
arms
will
load
myself
with
the
rest
the
eatables
and
with
the
more
delicate
instruments

But
exclaimed
our
clothes
this
mass
cord
and
ladders—who
will
undertake
carry
them
down

They
will
down
themselves

And
how
asked

You
shall
see

uncle
was
not
fond
half
measures
nor
did
like
anything
the
way
hesitation
Giving
his
orders
Hans
had
the
whole
the
nonfragile
articles
made
into
one
bundle
and
the
packet
firmly
and
solidly
fastened
was
simply
pitched
over
the
edge
the
gulf

heard
the
moaning
the
suddenly
displaced
air
and
the
noise
falling
stones
uncle
leaning
over
the
abyss
followed
the
descent
his
luggage
with
perfectly
self-satisfied
air
and
did
not
rise
until
had
completely
disappeared
from
sight

Now
then
cried
our
turn

put
good
faith
any
man
common
sense—was
possible
hear
this
energetic
cry
without
shudder

The
Professor
fastened
his
case
instruments
his
back
Hans
took
charge
the
tools
the
arms
The
descent
then
commenced
the
following
order:
Hans
went
first
uncle
followed
and
went
last
Our
progress
was
made
profound
silence—a
silence
only
troubled
the
fall
pieces
rock
which
breaking
from
the
jagged
sides
fell
with
roar
into
the
depths
below

allowed
myself
slide
speak
holding
frantically
the
double
cord
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
keeping
myself
off
the
rocks
the
assistance
iron-shod
pole
One
idea
was
all
the
time
impressed
upon
brain
feared
that
the
upper
support
would
fail
The
cord
appeared
far
too
fragile
bear
the
weight
three
such
persons
were
with
our
luggage
made
little
use
possible
trusting
own
agility
and
doing
miracles
the
way
feats
dexterity
and
strength
upon
the
projecting
shelves
and
spurs
lava
which
feet
seemed
clutch
strongly
hands

The
guide
went
first
have
said
and
when
one
the
slippery
and
frail
supports
broke
from
under
his
feet
had
recourse
his
usual
monosyllabic
way
speaking

Gif
akt—

Attention—look
out
repeated
uncle

about
half
hour
reached
kind
small
terrace
formed
fragment
rock
projecting
some
distance
from
the
sides
the
shaft

Hans
now
began
haul
upon
the
cord
one
side
only
the
other
going
quietly
upward
the
other
came
down
fell
last
bringing
with
shower
small
stones
lava
and
dust
disagreeable
kind
rain
hail

While
were
seated
this
extraordinary
bench
ventured
once
more
look
downwards
With
sigh
discovered
that
the
bottom
was
still
wholly
invisible
Were
then
going
direct
the
interior
the
earth

The
performance
with
the
cord
recommenced
and
quarter
hour
later
had
reached
the
depth
another
two
hundred
feet

have
very
strong
doubts
the
most
determined
geologist
would
during
that
descent
have
studied
the
nature
the
different
layers
earth
around
him
did
not
trouble
head
much
about
the
matter
whether
were
among
the
combustible
carbon
Silurians
primitive
soil
neither
knew
nor
cared
know

Not
the
inveterate
Professor
must
have
taken
notes
all
the
way
down
for
one
our
halts
began
brief
lecture

The
farther
advance
said
the
greater
confidence
the
result
The
disposition
these
volcanic
strata
absolutely
confirms
the
theories
Sir
Humphry
Davy
are
still
within
the
region
the
primordial
soil
the
soil
which
took
place
the
chemical
operation

and

central
fire
all

know
the
truth

Such
was
the
everlasting
conclusion
which
came
however
was
very
far
from
being
humor
discuss
the
matter
had
something
else
think
silence
was
taken
for
consent
and
still
continued
down

the
expiration
three
hours
were
all
appearance
far
off
ever
from
the
bottom
the
well
When
looked
upwards
however
could
see
that
the
upper
orifice
was
every
minute
decreasing
size
The
sides
the
shaft
were
getting
closer
and
closer
together
were
approaching
the
regions
eternal
night

And
still
continued

length
noticed
that
when
pieces
stone
were
detached
from
the
sides
this
stupendous
precipice
they
were
swallowed
with
less
noise
than
before
The
final
sound
was
sooner
heard

approaching
the

the
abyss

had
been
very
careful
keep
account
all
the
changes

which
took
place
was
able
tell
exactly
what
was
the
depth
had
reached
well
the
time
had
taken

had
shifted
the
rope
twenty-eight
times
each
operation
taking
quarter
hour
which
all
made
seven
hours
this
had
added
twenty-eight
pauses
all
ten
hours
and
half
started
one
was
now
therefore
about
eleven
o'clock
night

does
not
require
great
knowledge

know
that
twenty-eight
times
two

feet
makes
five

six
hundred
feet
all
more
than

While
was
making
this
mental
calculation

broke
the
silence
was
the
voice

suddenly

but
made
observations
that
point
was
fairly
launched

course
and
all
had
was
forward
hopefully
and
trustingly

was
not
even
now
quite
dark
the
light
filtering
down
most
extraordinary
manner

opened
the
provision
bag
ate
frugal
supper
and
each
did
his
best
find
bed
amid
the
pile
stones
dirt
and
lava
which
had
accumulated
for
ages
the
bottom
the
shaft

happened
grope
out
the
pile
ropes
ladders
and
clothes
which
had
thrown
down
and
upon
them
stretched
myself
After
such
day's
labor
rough
bed
seemed
soft
down

For
while
lay
sort
pleasant
trance

Presently
after
lying
quietly
for
some
minutes

OUR
DESCENT

eight
o'clock
the
next
morning
faint
kind
dawn
day
awoke
The
thousand
and
one
prisms
the
lava
collected
the
light
passed
and
brought
like
shower
sparks

were
able
with
ease
see
objects
around
Well
Harry
boy
cried
the
delighted
Professor
rubbing
his
hands
together
what
say
you
now
Did
you
ever
pass
more
tranquil
night
our
house
the
Konigstrasse
deafening
sounds
cart
wheels
cries
hawkers
bad
language
from
boatmen
watermen

Well
Uncle
are
quite
the
bottom
this
well—but
there
something
terrible
this
calm

Why
said
the
Professor
hotly
one
would
say
you
were
already
beginning
afraid
How
will
you
get
presently
you
know
that
yet
have
not
penetrated
one
inch
into
the
bowels
the
earth

What
can
you
mean
sir
was
bewildered
and
astonished
reply

mean
say
that
have
only
just
reached
the
soil
the
island
itself
This
long
vertical
tube
which
ends
the
bottom
the
crater
Sneffels
ceases
here
just
about
level
with
the
sea

Are
you
sure
sir

Quite
sure
Consult
the
barometer

was
quite
true
that
the
mercury
after
rising
gradually
the
instrument
long
our
descent
was
taking
place
had
stopped
precisely
twenty-nine
degrees

You
perceive
said
the
Professor
have
yet
only
endure
the
pressure
air
curious
replace
the
barometer
the
manometer

The
barometer
fact
was
about
become
useless—as
soon
the
weight
the
air
was
greater
than
what
was
calculated
above
the
level
the
ocean

But
said
not
very
much
feared
that
this
ever-increasing
pressure
may
not
the
end
turn
out
very
painful
and
inconvenient

said
shall
descend
very
slowly
and
our
lungs
will
gradually
accustomed
breathe
compressed
air
well
known
that
aeronauts
have
gone
high
nearly
without
air
all—why
then
should
not
accustom
ourselves
breathe
when
have
say
little
too
much
For
myself
certain
shall
prefer
Let
not
lose
moment
Where
the
packet
which
preceded
our
descent

smilingly
pointed
out
uncle
Hans
had
not
seen
and
believed
caught
somewhere
above
us:
Huppe
phrased
Now
said
uncle
let
breakfast
and
break
fast
like
people
who
have
long
day's
work
before
them

Biscuit
and
dried
meat
washed
down
some
mouthfuls
water
flavored
with
Schiedam
was
the
material
our
luxurious
meal

soon
was
finished
uncle
took
from
his
pocket
notebook
destined
filled
memoranda
our
travels
had
already
placed
his
instruments
order
and
this
what
wrote:

This
last
observation
referred
the
obscure
gallery
and
was
indicated
the
compass

Now
Harry
cried
the
Professor
enthusiastic
tone
voice
are
truly
about
take
our
first
step
into
the
Interior
the
Earth
never
before
visited
man
since
the
first
creation
the
world
You
may
consider
therefore
that
this
precise
moment
our
travels
really
commence

uncle
made
this
remark
took
one
hand
the
Ruhmkorff
coil
apparatus
which
hung
round
his
neck
and
with
the
other
put
the
electric
current
into
communication
with
the
worm
the
lantern
And
bright
light
once
illumined
that
dark
and
gloomy
tunnel

The
effect
was
magical

Hans
who
carried
the
second
apparatus
had
also
put
into
operation
This
ingenious
application
electricity
practical
purposes
enabled
move
along
the
light
artificial
day
amid
even
the
flow
the
most
inflammable
and
combustible
gases

Forward
cried
uncle
Each
took
his
burden
Hans
went
first
uncle
followed
and
going
third
entered
the
somber
gallery

Just
were
about
engulf
ourselves
this
dismal
passage
lifted
head
and
through
the
tubelike
shaft
saw
that
Iceland
sky
was
never
see
again

Was
the
last
should
ever
see
any
sky

The
stream
lava
flowing
from
the
bowels
the
earth
had
forced
itself
passage
through
the
tunnel
lined
the
whole
the
inside
with
its
thick
and
brilliant
coating
The
electric
light
added
very
greatly
the
brilliancy
the
effect

The
great
difficulty
our
journey
now
began
How
were
prevent
ourselves
from
slipping
down
the
steeply
inclined
plane
Happily
some
cracks
abrasures
the
soil
and
other
irregularities
served
the
place
steps
and
descended
slowly
allowing
our
heavy
luggage
slip
before
the
end
long
cord

But
that
which
served
steps
under
our
feet
became
other
places
stalactites
The
lava
very
porous
certain
places
took
the
form
little
round
blisters
Crystals
opaque
quartz
adorned
with
limpid
drops
natural
glass
suspended
the
roof
like
lusters
seemed
take
fire
passed
beneath
them
One
would
have
fancied
that
the
genii
romance
were
illuminating
their
underground
palaces
receive
the
sons
men

Magnificent
glorious
cried
moment
involuntary
enthusiasm
What
spectacle
Uncle
you
not
admire
these
variegated
shades
lava
which
run
through
whole
series
colors
from
reddish
brown
pale
yellow—by
the
most
insensible
degrees
And
these

are

the
charms

Master
Harry
cried
uncle
Wait
bit
until
advance
farther
What
have
yet
discovered
nothing—onwards
boy
onwards

would
have
been
far
more
correct
and
appropriate
expression
had
said
let
slide
for
were
going
down
inclined
plane
with
perfect
ease
The
compass
indicated
that
were
moving
southeasterly
direction
The
flow
lava
had
never
turned
the
right
the
left
had
the
inflexibility
straight
line

Nevertheless
surprise
found
perceptible
increase
heat
This
proved
the
theories
Humphry
Davy
founded
truth
and
more
than
once
found
myself
examining
the
thermometer
silent
astonishment

Two
hours
after
our
departure
only
marked
fifty-four
degrees
Fahrenheit
had
every
reason
believe
from
this
that
our
descent
was
far
more
horizontal
than
vertical
for
discovering
the
exact
depth
which
had
attained
nothing
could
easier
The
Professor
advanced
measured
the
angles
deviation
and
inclination
but
kept
the
result
his
observations
himself

About
eight
o'clock
the
evening
uncle
gave
the
signal
for
halting
Hans
seated
himself
the
ground
The
lamps
were
hung
fissures
the
lava
rock
were
now
large
cavern
where
air
was
not
wanting
the
contrary
abounded
What
could
the
cause
this—to
what
atmospheric
agitation
could
ascribed
this
draught
But
this
was
question
which
did
not
care
discuss
just
then
Fatigue
and
hunger
made
incapable
reasoning
unceasing
march
seven
hours
had
not
been
kept
without
great
exhaustion
was
really
and
truly
worn
out
and
delighted
enough
was
hear
the
word
Halt

Hans
laid
out
some
provisions
lump
lava
and
each
supped
with
keen
relish
One
thing
however
caused
great
uneasiness—our
water
reserve
was
already
half
exhausted
uncle
had
full
confidence
finding
subterranean
resources
but
hitherto
had
completely
failed
doing
could
not
help
calling
uncle's
attention
the
circumstance

And
you
are
surprised
this
total
absence
springs
said

Doubtless—I
very
uneasy
the
point
have
certainly
not
enough
water
last
five
days

quite
easy
that
matter
continued
uncle
answer
for
shall
find
plenty
water—in
fact
far
more
than
shall
want

But
when

When
once
get
through
this
crust
lava
How
can
you
expect
springs
force
their
way
through
these
solid
stone
walls

But
what
there
prove
that
this
concrete
mass
lava
does
not
extend
the
centre
the
earth
don't
think
have
yet
done
much
vertical
way

What
puts
that
into
your
head
boy
asked
uncle
mildly

Well
appears
that
had
descended
very
far
below
the
level
the
sea—we
should
find
rather
hotter
than
have

According
your
system
said
uncle
but
what
does
the
thermometer
say

Scarcely
fifteen
degrees
Reaumur
which
only
increase
nine
since
our
departure

Well
and
what
conclusion
does
that
bring
you
inquired
the
Professor

The
deduction
draw
from
this
very
simple
According
the
most
exact
observations
the
augmentation
the
temperature
the
interior
the
earth
one
degree
for
every
hundred
feet
But
certain
local
causes
may
considerably
modify
this
figure
Thus
Yakoust
Siberia
has
been
remarked
that
the
heat
increases
degree
every
thirty-six
feet
The
difference
evidently
depends
the
conductibility
certain
rocks
the
neighborhood
extinct
volcano
has
been
remarked
that
the
elevation
temperature
was
only
one
degree
every
five-and-twenty
feet
Let
then
upon
this
calculation—which
the
most
favorable—and
calculate

Calculate
away
boy

Nothing
easier
said
pulling
out
notebook
and
pencil
Nine
times
one
hundred
and
twenty-five
feet
make
depth
eleven
hundred
and
twenty-five
feet

Archimedes
could
not
have
spoken
more
geometrically

Well

Well
according
observations
are
least
ten
thousand
feet
below
the
level
the
sea

Can
possible

Either
calculation
correct
there
truth
figures

The
calculations
the
Professor
were
perfectly
correct
were
already
six
thousand
feet
deeper
down
the
bowels
the
earth
than
anyone
had
ever
been
before
The
lowest
known
depth
which
man
had
hitherto
penetrated
was
the
mines
Kitzbuhel
the
Tirol
and
those
Wurttemberg

The
temperature
which
should
have
been
eighty-one
was
this
place
only
fifteen
This
was
matter
for
serious
consideration

CHAPTER
THE
EASTERN
TUNNEL

The
next
day
was
Tuesday
the
June—and
six
o'clock
the
morning
resumed
our
journey

still
continued
follow
the
gallery
lava
perfect
natural
pathway
easy
descent
some
those
inclined
planes
which
very
old
German
houses
serve
the
purpose
staircases
This
went
until
seventeen
minutes
past
twelve
the
precise
instant
which
rejoined
Hans
who
having
been
somewhat
advance
had
suddenly
stopped

last
cried
uncle
have
reached
the
end
the
shaft

looked
wonderingly
about
were
the
centre
four
cross
paths—somber
and
narrow
tunnels
The
question
now
arose
which
was
wise
take
and
this
itself
was
small
difficulty

uncle
who
did
not
wish
appear
have
any
hesitation
about
the
matter
before
myself
the
guide
once
made
his
mind
pointed
quietly
the
eastern
tunnel
and
without
delay
entered
within
its
gloomy
recesses

Besides
had
entertained
any
feeling
hesitation
might
have
been
prolonged
indefinitely
for
there
was
indication
which
determine
choice
was
absolutely
necessary
trust
chance
and
good
fortune

The
descent
this
obscure
and
narrow
gallery
was
very
gradual
and
winding
Sometimes
gazed
through
succession
arches
its
course
very
like
the
aisles
Gothic
cathedral
The
great
artistic
sculptors
and
builders
the
Middle
Ages
might
have
here
completed
their
studies
with
advantage
Many
most
beautiful
and
suggestive
ideas
architectural
beauty
would
have
been
discovered
them
After
passing
through
this
phase
the
cavernous
way
suddenly
came
about
mile
farther
upon
square
system
arch
adopted
the
early
Romans
projecting
from
the
solid
rock
and
keeping
the
weight
the
roof

Suddenly
would
come
upon
series
low
subterranean
tunnels
which
looked
like
beaver
holes
the
work
foxes—through
whose
narrow
and
winding
ways
had
literally
crawl

The
heat
still
remained
quite
supportable
degree
With
involuntary
shudder
reflected
what
the
heat
must
have
been
when
the
volcano
Sneffels
was
pouring
its
smoke
flames
and
streams
boiling
lava—all
which
must
have
come
the
road
were
now
following
could
imagine
the
torrents
hot
seething
stone
darting
bubbling
with
accompaniments
smoke
steam
and
sulphurous
stench

Only
think
the
consequences
mused
the
old
volcano
were
once
more
set
work

did
not
communicate
these
rather
unpleasant
reflections
uncle
not
only
would
not
have
understood
them
but
would
have
been
intensely
disgusted
His
only
idea
was
ahead
walked
slid
clambered
over
piles
fragments
rolled
down
heaps
broken
lava
with
earnestness
and
conviction
was
impossible
not
admire

six
o'clock
the
evening
after
very
wearisome
journey
but
one
not
fatiguing
before
had
made
six
miles
towards
the
southward
but
had
not
gone
more
than
mile
downwards

uncle
usual
gave
the
signal
halt
ate
our
meal
thoughtful
silence
and
then
retired
sleep

Our
arrangements
for
the
night
were
very
primitive
and
simple
traveling
rug
which
each
rolled
himself
was
all
our
bedding
had
necessity
fear
cold
any
unpleasant
visit
Travelers
who
bury
themselves
the
wilds
and
depths
the
African
desert
who
seek
profit
and
pleasure
the
forests
the
New
World
are
compelled
take
turn
watch
during
the
hours
sleep
but
this
region
the
earth
absolute
solitude
and
complete
security
reigned
supreme

had
nothing
fear
either
from
savages
from
wild
beasts

After
night's
sweet
repose
awoke
fresh
and
ready
for
action
There
being
nothing
detain
started
our
journey
continued
burrow
through
the
lava
tunnel
before
was
impossible
make
out
through
what
soil
were
making
way
The
tunnel
moreover
instead
going
down
into
the
bowels
the
earth
became
absolutely
horizontal

even
thought
after
some
examination
that
were
actually
tending
upwards
About
ten
o'clock
the
day
this
state
things
became
clear
that
finding
the
change
very
fatiguing
was
obliged
slacken
pace
and
finally
come
halt

Well
said
the
Professor
quickly
what
the
matter

The
fact
dreadfully
tired
was
earnest
reply

What
cried
uncle
tired
after
three
hours'
walk
and
easy
road

Easy
enough
dare
say
but
very
fatiguing

But
how
can
that
when
all
have
downwards

beg
your
pardon
sir
For
some
time
have
noticed
that
are
going
upwards

Upwards
cried
uncle
shrugging
his
shoulders
how
can
that
There
can
doubt
about
For
the
last
half
hour
the
slopes
have
been
upward—and
this
way
much
longer
shall
find
ourselves
back
Iceland

uncle
shook
his
head
with
the
air
man
who
does
not
want
convinced
tried
continue
the
conversation
would
not
answer
but
once
more
gave
the
signal
for
departure
His
silence
thought
was
only
caused
concentrated
ill-temper

However
this
might
once
more
took
load
and
boldly
and
resolutely
followed
Hans
who
was
now
advance
uncle
did
not
like
beaten
even
distanced
was
naturally
anxious
not
lose
sight
companions
The
very
idea
being
left
behind
lost
that
terrible
labyrinth
made
shiver
with
the
ague

Besides
the
ascending
path
was
more
arduous
and
painful
clamber
had
one
source
secret
consolation
and
delight
was
all
appearance
taking
back
the
surface
the
earth
That
itself
was
hopeful
Every
step
took
confirmed
belief
and
began
already
build
castles
the
air
relation
marriage
with
pretty
little
cousin

About
twelve
o'clock
there
was
great
and
sudden
change
the
aspect
the
rocky
sides
the
gallery
first
noticed
from
the
diminution
the
rays
light
which
cast
back
the
reflection
the
lamp
From
being
coated
with
shining
and
resplendent
lava
became
living
rock
The
sides
were
sloping
walls
which
sometimes
became
quite
vertical

were
now
what
the
geological
professors
call
state
transition
the
period
Silurian
stones
called
because
this
specimen
early
formation
very
common
England

counties

inhabited
the
Celtic

known
Silures

can
see
clearly
now
cried
the
sediment
from
the
waters
which
once
covered
the
whole
earth
formed
during
the
second
period
its
existence
these
schists
and
these
calcareous
rocks
are
turning
our
backs
the
granite
rocks
and
are
like
people
from
Hamburg
who
would
Lubeck

Hanover

might
just
well
have
kept
observations
myself
geological
enthusiasm
got
the
better
however
cooler
judgment
and
Professor
Hardwigg
heard
observations

What
the
matter
now
said
tone
great
gravity

Well
cried
you
not
see
these
different
layers
calcareous
rocks
and
the
first
indication
slate
strata

Well
what
then

have
arrived
that
period
the
world's
existence
when
the
first
plants
and
the
first
animals
made
their
appearance

You
think
Yes
look
examine
and
judge
for
yourself

induced
the
Professor
with
some
difficulty
cast
the
light
his
lamp
the
sides
the
long
winding
gallery
expected
some
exclamation
burst
from
his
lips
was
very
much
mistaken
The
worthy
Professor
never
spoke
word

was
impossible
say
whether
understood
not
Perhaps
was
possible
that
his
pride—my
uncle
and
learned
professor—he
did
not
like
own
that
was
wrong
having
chosen
the
eastern
tunnel
was
determined
any
price
the
end
was
quite
evident
had
left
the
region
lava
and
that
the
road
which
were
going
could
not
take
back
the
great
crater
Mount
Sneffels

went
along
could
not
help
ruminating
the
whole
question
and
asked
myself
did
not
lay
too
great
stress
these
sudden
and
peculiar
modifications
the
earth's
crust

After
all
was
very
likely
mistaken—and
was
within
the
range
probability
and
possibility
that
were
not
making
our
way
through
the
strata
rocks
which
believed
recognized
piled
the
lower
layer
granitic
formation

all
events
right
thought
myself
must
certainly
find
some
remains
primitive
plants
and
will
absolutely
necessary
give
way
such
indubitable
evidence
Let
have
good
search

accordingly
lost
opportunity

and
had
not
gone
more
than
about
hundred
yards
when
the
evidence
sought
for

the
most
incontestable
manner
before

was
quite
natural
that
should
expect

these
signs
for

the
Silurian
period
the
seas
contained
fewer
than
fifteen
hundred
different
animal
and
vegetable
species
feet
long
accustomed
the
hard
and
arid
lava
soil
suddenly
found
themselves
treading
kind
soft
dust
the

and
shells

Upon
the
walls
themselves
could
clearly
make
out
the
outline

fucus

The
worthy
and
excellent
Professor
Hardwigg
could
not

make
any
mistake
about
the
matter
but
believe
deliberately
closed
his
eyes
and
continued
his
way
with
firm
and
unalterable
step

compelled
put
ourselves
upon
rations
Our
supply
would
certainly
last
not
more
than
three
days
found
this
out
about
supper
time
The
worst
part
the
matter
was
that
what
called
the
transition
rocks
was
hardly
expected
should
meet
with
water

had
read
the
horrors
thirst
and
knew
that
where
were

its
sufferings
would
put
end
our
adventures—and
our
lives
But
was
utterly
useless
discuss
the
matter
with
uncle
would
have
answered
some
axiom
from
Plato

During
the
whole
next
day
proceeded
our
journey
through
this
interminable
gallery

after

mute
and
reticent
Hans
our
guide

The
road
had
longer
upward
tendency
all
events
had
was
not
made
out
very
clearly
Sometimes
there
could
doubt
that
were
going
downwards
But
this
inclination
was
scarcely
distinguished
and
was
means
reassuring
the
Professor
because
the
character
the
strata
was
wise
modified
and
the
transition
character
the
rocks
became
more
and
more
marked

was
glorious
sight
see
how
the
electric
light
brought
out
the
sparkles
the
walls
the
calcareous
rocks
and
the
old
red
sandstone
One
might
have
fancied
oneself
one
those
deep
cuttings
Devonshire
which
have
given
their
name
this
kind
soil
Some
magnificent
specimens
marble
projected
from
the
sides
the
gallery:
some
agate
grey
with
white
veins
variegated
character
others
yellow
spotted
color
with
red
veins
farther
off
might
seen
samples
color
which
cherry-tinted
seams
were
found
all
their
brightest
shades

The
greater
number
these
marbles
were
stamped
with
the
marks
primitive
animals
Since
the
previous
evening
nature
and
creation
had
made
considerable
progress
Instead
the
rudimentary
trilobites
perceived
the
remains
more
perfect
order
Among
others
the
fish
which
the
eye
geologist
has
been
able
discover
the
first

The

and
thus

him

his

that
some

would
compel
stop
and
back
the
road
had
long
traveled
But
evening
came
again
and
horror
neither
hope
was
doomed
realized

Friday
after
night
when
began
feel
the
gnawing
agony
thirst
and
when
consequence
appetite
decreased
our
little
band
rose
and
once
more
followed
the
turnings
and
windings
the
ascents
and
descents
this
interminable
gallery
All
were
silent
and
gloomy
could
see
that
even
uncle
had
ventured
too
far

After
about
ten
hours
further
progress—a
progress
dull
and
monotonous
the
last
degree—I
remarked
that
the
reverberation
and
reflection
our
lamps
upon
the
sides
the
tunnel
had
singularly
diminished
The
marble
the
schist
the
calcareous
rocks
the
red
sandstone
had
disappeared
leaving
their
places
dark
and
gloomy
wall
somber
and
without
brightness
When
reached
remarkably
narrow
part
the
tunnel
leaned

against

the
work
nature
not
little
concern
The
hour
for
our
evening
meal
has
come—let
sup

Hans
the
guide
occupied
himself
preparing
food
had
come
that
point
when
could
longer
eat
All
cared
about
were
the
few
drops
water
which
fell
share
What
suffered
useless
record
The
guide's
gourd
not
quite
half
full
was
all
that
was
left
for
three

Having
finished
their
repast
two
companions
laid
themselves
down
upon
their
rugs
and
found
sleep
remedy
for
their
fatigue
and
sufferings
for
could
not
sleep
lay
counting
the
hours
until
morning

The
next
morning
Saturday
six
o'clock
started
again
Twenty
minutes
later
suddenly
came
upon
vast
excavation
From
its
mighty
extent
saw
once
that
the
hand
man
could
have
had
nothing
with
this
coal
mine
the
vault
above
would
have
fallen
was
was
only
held
together
some
miracle
nature

This
mighty
natural
cavern
was
about
hundred
feet
wide
about
hundred
and
fifty
high
The
earth
had
evidently
been
cast
apart
some
violent
subterranean
commotion
The
mass
giving
way
some
prodigious
upheaving
nature
had
split
two
leaving
the
vast
gap
into
which
inhabitants
the
earth
had
penetrated
for
the
first
time

The
whole
singular
history
the
coal
period
was
written
those
dark
and
gloomy
walls
geologist
would
have
been
able
easily
follow
the
different
phases
its
formation
The
seams
coal
were
separated
strata
sandstone
compact
clay
which
appeared
crushed
down
the
weight
from
above

that
period
the
world
which
preceded
the
secondary
epoch
the
earth
was
covered
coating
enormous
and
rich
vegetation
due
the
double
action
tropical
heat
and
perpetual
humidity
vast
atmospheric
cloud
vapor
surrounded
the
earth
all
sides
preventing
the
rays
the
sun
from
ever
reaching
Hence
the
conclusion
that
these
intense
heats
did
not
arise
from
this
new
source
caloric

Perhaps
even
the
star
day
was
not
quite
ready
for
its
brilliant
work—to
illumine
universe
Climates
did
not
yet
exist
and
level
heat
pervaded
the
whole
surface
the
globe—the
same
heat
existing
the
North
Pole
the
equator

Whence
did
come
From
the
interior
the
earth

spite
all
the
learned
theories
Professor
Hardwigg
fierce
and
vehement
fire
certainly
burned
within
the
entrails
the
great
spheroid
Its
action
was
felt
even
the
very
topmost
crust
the
earth
the
plants
then
existence
being
deprived
the
vivifying
rays
the
sun
had
neither
buds
nor
flowers
nor
odor
but
their
roots
drew
strong
and
vigorous
life
from
the
burning
earth
early
days

There
were
but
few
what
may
called
trees—only
herbaceous
plants
immense
turfs
briers
mosses
rare
families
which
however
those
days
were
counted
tens
and
tens
thousands

entirely
this
exuberant
vegetation
that
coal
owes
its
origin
The
crust
the
vast
globe
still
yielded
under
the
influence
the
seething
boiling
mass
which
was
forever
work
beneath
Hence
arose
numerous
fissures
and
continual
falling
the
upper
earth
The
dense
mass
plants
being
beneath
the
waters
soon
formed
themselves
into
vast
agglomerations

Then
came
about
the
action
natural
chemistry
the
depths
the
ocean
the
vegetable
mass
first
became
turf
then
thanks
the
influence
gases
and
subterranean
fermentation
they
underwent
the
complete
process
mineralization

this
manner
early
days
were
formed
those
vast
and
prodigious
layers
coal
which
ever—increasing
consumption
must
utterly
use
about
three
centuries
more
people
not
find
some
more
economic
light
than
gas
and
some
cheaper
motive
power
than
steam

All
these
reflections
the
memories
school
studies
came
mind
while
gazed
upon
these
mighty
accumulations
coal
whose
riches
however
are
scarcely
likely
ever
utilized
The
working
these
mines
could
only
carried
out
expense
that
would
never
yield
profit

The
matter
however
scarcely
worthy
consideration
when
coal
scattered
over
the
whole
surface
the
globe
within
few
yards
the
upper
crust
looked
these
untouched
strata
therefore
knew
they
would
remain
long
the
world
lasts

While
still
continued
our
journey
alone
forgot
the
length
the
road
giving
myself
wholly
these
geological
considerations
The
temperature
continued
very
much
the
same
while
were
traveling
amid
the
lava
and
the
schists
the
other
hand
sense
smell
was
much
affected
very
powerful
odor
immediately
knew
that
the
gallery
was
filled
overflowing
with
that
dangerous
gas
the
miners
call
fire
damp
the
explosion
which
has
caused
such
fearful
and
terrible
accidents
making
hundred
widows
and
hundreds
orphans

Happily
were
able

our
progress

apparatus

been

and
imprudent

this
gallery
torch

terrible
explosion
would
have
put
end
our
travels
simply
because
travelers
would
left

Our
excursion
through
this
wondrous
coal
mine
the
very
bowels
the
earth
lasted
until
evening
uncle
was
scarcely
able
conceal
his
impatience
and
dissatisfaction
the
road
continuing
still
advance
horizontal
direction

The
darkness
dense
and
opaque
few
yards
advance
and
the
rear
rendered
impossible
make
out
what
was
the
length
the
gallery
For
myself
began
believe
that
was
simply
interminable
and
would
the
same
manner
for
months

Suddenly
six
o'clock
stood
front
wall
the
right
the
left
above
below
nowhere
was
there
any
passage
had
reached
spot
where
the
rocks
said
unmistakable
accents—No
Thoroughfare

stood
stupefied
The
guide
simply
folded
his
arms
uncle
was
silent

Well
well
much
the
better
cried
uncle

now

what
are
about

decidedly
not

road

Saknussemm
All

Let
take
one
night's
good
rest
and
before

days
are
over
promise
you
shall
have
regained
the
point
where
the
galleries
divided

Yes
may
our
strength

cried
lamentable
voice

And
why
not

Tomorrow
among
three
there
will
not
drop

And

courage
with
said
uncle
speaking
severe
tone

What
could
say
turned
round
side
and
from
sheer
exhaustion
fell
into
heavy
sleep
disturbed

And
awoke
unrefreshed

would
have

CHAPTER
THE
WRONG
ROAD

Next
day
our
departure
took
place
very
early
hour
There
was
time
for
the
least
delay
According
account
had
five
days'
hard
work
get
back
the
place
where
the
galleries
divided

can
never
tell
all
the
sufferings
endured
upon
our
return
uncle
bore
them
like
man
who
has
been
the
wrong—that
with
concentrated
and
suppressed
anger
Hans
with
all
the
resignation
his
pacific
character
and
I—I
confess
that
did
nothing
but
complain
and
despair
had
heart
for
this
bad
fortune

But
there
was
one
consolation
Defeat
the
outset
would
probably
upset
the
whole
journey

had
expected
from
the
first
our
supply
water
gave
completely
out
our
first
day's
march
Our
provision
liquids
was
reduced
our
supply
Schiedam
but
this
horrible—nay
will
say
it—this
infernal
liquor
burnt
the
throat
and
could
not
even
bear
the
sight
found
the
temperature
stifling
was
paralyzed
with
fatigue
More
than
once
was
about
fall
insensible
the
ground
The
whole
party
then
halted
and
the
worthy
Icelander
and
excellent
uncle
did
their
best
console
and
comfort
could
however
plainly
see
that
uncle
was
contending
painfully
against
the
extreme
fatigues
our
journey
and
the
awful
torture
generated
the
absence
water

length
time
came
when
ceased
recollect
anything—when
all
was
one
awfull
hideous
fantastic
dream

last
Tuesday
the
seventh
the
month
July
after
crawling
our
hands
and
knees
for
many
hours
more
dead
than
alive
reached
the
point
junction
between
the
galleries
lay
like
log
inert
mass
human
flesh
the
arid
lava
soil
was
then
ten
the
morning

Hans
and
uncle
leaning
against
the
wall
tried
nibble
away
some
pieces
biscuit
while
deep
groans
and
sighs
escaped
from
scorched
and
swollen
lips
Then
fell
off
into
kind
deep
lethargy

Presently
felt
uncle
approach
and
lift
tenderly
his
arms

Poor
boy
heard
him
say
tone
deep
commiseration

was
profoundly
touched
these
words
being
means
accustomed
signs
womanly
weakness
the
Professor
caught
his
trembling
hands
mine
and
gave
them
gentle
pressure
allowed
without
resistance
looking
kindly
all
the
time
His
eyes
were
wet
with
tears

then
saw
him
take
the
gourd
which
wore
his
side
surprise
rather
stupefaction
placed
lips

Drink
boy
said

Was
possible
ears
had
not
deceived
Was
uncle
mad
looked
him
with
sure
quite
idiotic
expression
could
not
believe
him
too
much
feared
the
counteraction
disappointment

Drink
said
again

Had
heard
aright
Before
however
could
ask
myself
the
question
second
time
mouthful
water
cooled
parched
lips
and
throat—one
mouthful
but
believe
brought
back
life

thanked
uncle
clasping
hands
heart
was
too
full
speak

Yes
said
one
mouthful
water
the
very
last—do
you
hear
boy—the
very
last
have
taken
care
the
bottom
bottle
the
apple
eye
Twenty
times
hundred
times
have
resisted
the
fearful
desire
drink
But—no—no
Harry
saved
for
you

dear
uncle
exclaimed
and
the
big
tears
rolled
down
hot
and
feverish
cheeks

Yes
poor
boy
knew
that
when
you
reached
this
place
this
crossroad
the
earth
you
would
fall
down
half
dead
and
saved
last
drop
water
order
restore
you

Thanks
cried
thanks
from
heart

little
thirst
was
really
quenched
had
nevertheless
partially
recovered
strength
The
contracted
muscles
throat
relaxed—and
the
inflammation
lips
some
measure
subsided
all
events
was
able
speak

Well
said
there
can
doubt
now
what
have
Water
has
utterly
failed
our
journey
therefore
end
Let
return

While
spoke
thus
uncle
evidently
avoided
face:
held
down
his
head
his
eyes
were
turned
every
possible
direction
but
the
right
one

Yes
continued
getting
excited
own
words
must
back
Sneffels
May
heaven
give
strength
enable
once
more
revisit
the
light
day
Would
that
now
stood
the
summit
the
crater

back
said
uncle
speaking
himself
and
must
back—yes
and
without
losing
single
moment
vehemently
cried

For
some
moments
there
was
silence
under
that
dark
and
gloomy
vault

dear
Harry
said
the
Professor
very
singular
tone
voice
those
few
drops
water
have
not
sufficed
restore
your
energy
and
courage

Courage
cried

see
that
you
are
quite
downcast
before—and
still
give
way
discouragement
and
despair

What
then
was
the
man
made
and
what
other
projects
were
entering
his
fertile
and
audacious
brain

You
are
not
discouraged
sir

What
Give
just
are
the
verge
success
cried
Never
never
shall
said
that
Professor
Hardwigg
retreated

Then
must
make
our
minds
perish
cried
with
helpless
sigh

Harry
boy
certainly
not
leave
very
far
from
desiring
your
death
Take
Hans
with
you
will
alone

You
ask
leave
you

Leave
say
have
undertaken
this
dangerous
and
perilous
adventure
will
carry
the
end—or
will
never
return
the
surface
Mother
Earth
Harry—once
more
say
you—go

uncle
spoke
was
terribly
excited
His
voice
which
before
had
been
tender
almost
womanly
became
harsh
and
menacing
appeared
struggling
with
desperate
energy
against
the
impossible
did
not
wish
abandon
him
the
bottom
that
abyss
while
the
other
hand
the
instinct
preservation
told
fly

Meanwhile
our
guide
was
looking
with
profound
calmness
and
indifference
appeared
unconcerned
party
and
yet
perfectly
well
knew
what
was
going
between
Our
gestures
sufficiently
indicated
the
different
roads
each
wished
follow—and
which
each
tried
influence
the
other
undertake
But
Hans
appeared
not
take
the
slightest
interest
what
was
really
question
life
and
death
for
all
but
waited
quite
ready
obey
the
signal
which
should
say
aloft
resume
his
desperate
journey
into
the
interior
the
earth

How
then
wished
with
all
heart
and
soul
that
could
make
him
understand
words
representations
sighs
and
groans
the
earnest
accents
which
should
have
spoken
would
have
convinced
that
cold
hard
nature
Those
fearful
dangers
and
perils
which
the
stolid
guide
had
idea
would
have
pointed
them
out
him—I
would
have
were
made
him
see
and
feel
Between

obstinate

The
Icelander
gently

The

sole

was

deep
incredulity

Listen
the
end
said
the
Professor
his
well-known
lecturing
voice
While
you
lay
yonder
without
life
motion
undertook
reconnoitering
journey
into
the
conformation
this
other
gallery
have
discovered
that
goes
directly
downwards
into
the
bowels
the
earth
and
few
hours
will
take
the
old
granitic
formation
this
shall
undoubtedly
find
innumerable

The
nature

makes

mathematical
certainty
and
instinct

logic
say
that
Now
this
the
serious
proposition
which
have
make
you
When
Christopher
Columbus
asked
his
men

days

his
men

him
three
days—and
the
New
World

Now

region
only
ask
you
one

when

time
expired

not
found

swear
you
will
give
mighty
enterprise
and
return

earth's
surface

Despite
irritation
and
despair
knew
how
much
cost
uncle
make
this
proposition
and
hold
such
conciliatory
language
Under
the
circumstances
what
could
but
yield

Well
cried
let
you
wish

may
heaven
reward
your
superhuman
energy
But

let

CHAPTER
THE
WESTERN
GALLERY—A
NEW
ROUTE

Our
descent
was
now
resumed
means
the
second
gallery
Hans
took
his
post
front
usual
had
not
gone
more
than
hundred
yards
when
the
Professor
carefully
examined
the
walls

This
the
primitive
formation—we
are
the
right
road—onwards
our
hope

When
the
whole
earth
got
cool
the
first
hours
the
world's
morning
the
diminution
the
volume
the
earth
produced
state
dislocation
its
upper
crust
followed
ruptures
crevasses
and
fissures
The
passage
was
fissure
this
kind
through
which
ages
ago
had
flowed
the
eruptive
granite
The
thousand
windings
and
turnings
formed
inextricable
labyrinth
through
the
ancient
soil

descended
successions
layers
composing
the
primitive
soil
appeared
with
the
utmost
fidelity
detail
Geological
science
considers
this
primitive
soil
the
base
the
mineral
crust
and
has
recognized
that
composed
three
different
strata
layers
all
resting
the
immovable
rock
known
granite

mineralogists
had
even
found
themselves
placed
such
marvelous
position
study
nature
all
her
real
and
naked
beauty
The
sounding
rod
mere
machine
could
not
bring
the
surface
the
earth
the
objects
value
for
the
study
its
internal
structure
which
were
about
see
with
our
own
eyes
touch
with
our
own
hands

Remember
that
writing
this
after
the
journey

Across
the
streak
the
rocks
colored
beautiful
green
tints
wound
metallic
threads
copper
manganese
with
traces
platinum
and
gold
could
not
help
gazing
these
riches
buried
the
entrails
Mother
Earth
and
which
man
would
have
the
enjoyment
the
end
time
These
treasures—mighty
and
inexhaustible
were
buried
the
morning
the
earth's
history
such
awful
depths
that
crowbar
pickax
will
ever
drag
them
from
their
tomb

The
light
our
Ruhmkorff's
coil
increased
tenfold
the
myriad
prismatic
masses
rock
sent
its
jets
fire
every
direction
and
could
fancy
myself
traveling
through
huge
hollow
diamond
the
rays
which
produced
myriads
extraordinary
effects

Towards
six
o'clock
this
festival
light
began
sensibly
and
visibly
decrease
and
soon
almost
ceased
The
sides
the
gallery
assumed
crystallized
tint
with
somber
hue
white
mica
began
commingle
more
freely
with
feldspar
and
quartz
form
what
may
called
the
true
rock—the
stone
which
hard
above
all
that
supports
without
being
crushed
the
four
stories
the
earth's
soil

were
walled
immense
prison
granite

was
now
eight
o'clock
and
still
there
was
sign
water
The
sufferings
endured
were
horrible
uncle
now
kept
the
head
our
little
column
Nothing
could
induce
him
stop
meanwhile
had
but
one
real
thought
ear
was
keenly
the
watch
catch
the
sound
spring
But
pleasant
sound
falling
water
fell
upon
listening
ear

But
last
the
time
came
when
limbs
refused
carry
longer
contended
heroically
against
the
terrible
tortures
endured
because
did
not
wish
compel
uncle
halt
him
knew
this
would
the
last
fatal
stroke

Suddenly
felt
deadly
faintness
come
over
eyes
could
longer
see
knees
shook
gave
one
despairing
cry—and
fell

Help
help
dying

uncle
turned
and
slowly
retraced
his
steps
looked
with
folded
arms
and
then
allowed
one
sentence
escape
hollow
accents
from
his
lips:

All
over

The
last
thing
saw
was
face
fearfully
distorted
with
pain
and
sorrow
and
then
eyes
closed

When
again
opened
them
saw
companions
lying
near
motionless
wrapped
their
huge
traveling
rugs
Were
they
asleep
dead
For
myself
sleep
was
wholly
out
the
question
fainting
fit
over
was
wakeful
the
lark
suffered
too
much
for
sleep
visit
eyelids—the
more
that
thought
myself
sick
unto
death—dying
The
last
words
spoken
uncle
seemed
buzzing
ears—all
over
And
was
probable
that
was
right
the
state
prostration
which
was
reduced
was
madness
think
ever
again
seeing
the
light
day

Above
were
miles
upon
miles
the
earth's
crust
thought
could
fancy
the
whole
weight
resting
shoulders
was
crushed
annihilated
and
exhausted
myself
vain
attempts
turn
granite
bed

Hours
upon
hours
passed
away
profound
and
terrible
silence
reigned
around
us—a
silence
the
tomb
Nothing
could
make
itself
heard
through
these
gigantic
walls
granite
The
very
thought
was
stupendous

Presently
despite
apathy
despite
the
kind
deadly
calm
into
which
was
cast
something
aroused
was
slight
but
peculiar
noise
While
was
watching
intently
observed
that
the
tunnel
was
becoming
dark
Then
gazing
through
the
dim
light
that
remained
thought
saw
the
Icelander
taking
his
departure
lamp
hand

Why
had
acted
thus
Did
Hans
the
guide
mean
abandon
uncle
lay
fast
asleep—or
dead
tried
cry
out
and
arouse
him
voice
feebly
issuing
from
parched
and
fevered
lips
found
echo
that
fearful
place
throat
was
dry
tongue
stuck
the
roof
mouth
The
obscurity
had
this
time
become
intense
and
last
even
the
faint
sound
the
guide's
footsteps
was
lost
the
blank
distance
soul
seemed
filled
with
anguish
and
death
appeared
welcome
only
let
come
quickly

Hans
leaving
cried
Hans—Hans
you
are
man
come
back

These
words
were
spoken
myself
They
could
not
heard
aloud
Nevertheless
after
the
first
few
moments
terror
were
over
was
ashamed
suspicions
against
man
who
hitherto
had
behaved
admirably
Nothing
his
conduct
character
justified
suspicion
Moreover
moment's
reflection
reassured
His
departure
could
not
flight
Instead
ascending
the
gallery
was
going
deeper
down
into
the
gulf
Had
had
any
bad
design
his
way
would
have
been
upwards

This
reasoning
calmed
little
and
began
hope

The
good
and
peaceful
and
imperturbable
Hans
would
certainly
not
have
arisen
from
his
sleep
without
some
serious
and
grave
motive
Was
bent
voyage
discovery
During
the
deep
still
silence
the
night
had
last
heard
that
sweet
murmur
about
which
were
all
anxious

CHAPTER
WATER
WHERE
BITTER
DISAPPOINTMENT

During
long
long
weary
hour
there
crossed
wildly
delirious
brain
all
sorts
reasons
what
could
have
aroused
our
quiet
and
faithful
guide
The
most
absurd
and
ridiculous
ideas
passed
through
head
each
more
impossible
than
the
other
believe
was
either
half
wholly
mad

Suddenly
however
there
arose
were
from
the
depths
the
earth
voice
comfort
was
the
sound
footsteps
Hans
was
returning

Presently
the
uncertain
light
began
shine
upon
the
walls
the
passage
and
then
came
view
far
down
the
sloping
tunnel
length
Hans
himself
appeared

approached
uncle
placed
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
gently
awakened
him
uncle
soon
saw
who
was
instantly
arose

Well
exclaimed
the
Professor

Vatten
said
the
hunter

did
not
know
single
word
the
Danish
language
and
yet
sort
mysterious
instinct
understood
what
the
guide
had
said

Water
water
cried
wild
and
frantic
tone
clapping
hands
and
gesticulating
like
madman

Water
murmured
uncle
voice
deep
emotion
and
gratitude
Hvar
Where

Nedat
Below

Where
below
understood
every
word
had
caught
the
hunter
the
hands
and
shook
them
heartily
while
looked
with
perfect
calmness

The
preparations
for
our
departure
did
not
take
long
and
were
soon
making
rapid
descent
into
the
tunnel

hour
later
had
advanced
thousand
yards
and
descended
two
thousand
feet

this
moment
heard
accustomed
and
well-known
sound
running
along
the
floors
the
granite
rock—a
kind
dull
and
sullen
roar
like
that
distant
waterfall

During
the
first
half
hour
our
advance
not
finding
the
discovered
spring
feelings
intense
suffering
appeared
return
Once
more
began
lose
all
hope
uncle
however
observing
how
downhearted
was
again
becoming
took
the
conversation

Hans
was
right
exclaimed
enthusiastically
that
the
dull
roaring
torrent

torrent
cried
delighted
even
hearing
the
welcome
words

There's
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
replied
subterranean
river
flowing
beside
made
reply
but
hastened
once
more
animated
hope
began
not
even
feel
the
deep
fatigue
which
hitherto
had
overpowered
The
very
sound
this
glorious
murmuring
water
already
refreshed
could
hear
increasing
volume
every
moment
The
torrent
which
for
long
time
could
heard
flowing
over
our
heads
now
ran
distinctly
along
the
left
wall
roaring
rushing
spluttering
and
still
falling

Several
times
passed
hand
across
the
rock
hoping
find
some
trace
humidity—of
the
slightest
percolation
Alas
vain

Again
half
hour
passed
the
same
weary
toil
Again
advanced

now
became
evident
that
the
hunter
during
his
absence
had
not
been
able
carry
his
researches
any
farther
Guided
instinct
peculiar
the
dwellers
mountain
regions
and
water
finders
smelt
the
living
spring
through
the
rock
Still
had
not
seen
the
precious
liquid
had
neither
quenched
his
own
thirst
nor
brought
one
drop
his
gourd

Moreover
soon
made
the
disastrous
discovery
that
our
progress
continued
should
soon
moving
away
from
the
torrent
the
sound
which
gradually
diminished
turned
back
Hans
halted
the
precise
spot
where
the
sound
the
torrent
appeared
nearest

could
bear
the
suspense
and
suffering
longer
and
seated
myself
against
the
wall
behind
which
could
hear
the
water
seething
and
effervescing
not
two
feet
away
But
solid
wall
granite
still
separated
from
Hans
looked
keenly
and
strange
enough
for
once
thought
saw
smile
his
imperturbable
face

rose
from
stone
which
had
been
seated
and
took
the
lamp
could
not
help
rising
and
following
moved
slowly
along
the
firm
and
solid
granite
wall
watched
him
with
mingled
curiosity
and
eagerness
Presently
halted
and
placed
his
ear
against
the
dry
stone
moving
slowly
along
and
listening
with
the
most
extreme
care
and
attention
understood
once
that
was
searching
for
the
exact
spot
where
the
torrent's
roar
was
most
plainly
heard
This
point
soon
found
the
lateral
wall
the
left
side
about
three
feet
above
the
level
the
tunnel
floor

was
state
intense
excitement
scarcely
dared
believe
what
the
eider-duck
hunter
was
about
was
however
impossible
moment
more
not
both
understand
and
applaud
and
even
smother
him
embraces
when
saw
him
raise
the
heavy
crowbar
and
commence
attack
upon
the
rock
itself

Saved
cried

Yes
cried
uncle
even
more
excited
and
delighted
than
myself
Hans
quite
right
the
worthy
excellent
man
should
never
have
thought
such
idea

And
nobody
else
think
would
have
done
Such
process
simple
seemed
would
most
certainly
not
have
entered
our
heads
Nothing
could
more
dangerous
than
begin
work
with
pickaxes
that
particular
part
the
globe
Supposing
while
was
work
break-up
were
take
place
and
supposing
the
torrent
once
having
gained
inch
were
take
ell
and
come
pouring
bodily
through
the
broken
rock

Not
one
these
dangers
was
chimerical
They
were
only
too
real
But
that
moment
fear
falling
the
roof
even
inundation
was
capable
stopping
Our
thirst
was
intense
that
quench
would
have
dug
below
the
bed
old
Ocean
itself

Hans
went
quietly
work—a
work
which
neither
uncle
nor
would
have
undertaken
any
price
Our
impatience
was
great
that
had
once
begun
with
pickax
and
crowbar
the
rock
would
soon
have
split
into
hundred
fragments
The
guide
the
contrary
calm
ready
moderate
wore
away
the
hard
rock
little
steady
blows
his
instrument
making
attempt
larger
hole
than
about
six
inches
stood
heard
thought
heard
the
roar
the
torrent
momentarily
increasing
loudness
and
times
almost
felt
the
pleasant
sensation
water
upon
parched
lips

the
end
what
appeared
age
Hans
had
made
hole
which
enabled
his
crowbar
enter
two
feet
into
the
solid
rock
had
been
work
exactly
hour
appeared
dozen
was
getting
wild
with
impatience
uncle
began
think
using
more
violent
measures
had
the
greatest
difficulty
checking
him
had
indeed
just
got
hold
his
crowbar
when
loud
and
welcome
hiss
was
heard
Then
stream
rather
jet
water
burst
through
the
wall
and
came
out
with
such
force
hit
the
opposite
side

Hans
the
guide
who
was
half
upset
the
shock
was
scarcely
able
keep
down
cry
pain
and
grief
understood
his
meaning
when
plunging
hands
into
the
sparkling
jet
myself
gave
wild
and
frantic
cry
The
water
was
scalding
hot

Boiling
cried
bitter
disappointment

Well
never
mind
said
uncle
will
soon
get
cool

The
tunnel
began
filled
clouds
vapor
while
small
stream
ran
away
into
the
interior
the
earth
short
time
had
some
sufficiently
cool
drink
swallowed
huge
mouthfuls

what
exalted
delight—what
rich
and
incomparable
luxury
What
was
this
water
whence
did
come
what
was
that
The
simple
fact
was—it
was
water
and
though
still
with
tingle
warmth
about
brought
back
the
heart
that
life
which
but
for
must
surely
have
faded
away
drank
greedily
almost
without
tasting
When
however
had
almost
quenched
ravenous
thirst
made
discovery

Why
chalybeate
water

most
excellent
stomachic
replied
uncle
and
highly
mineralized
Here

Spa

It's
very
good
replied

should
think
Water
found
six
miles
under
ground
There
peculiarly
inky
flavor
about
which
means
disagreeable
Hans
may
congratulate
himself
having
made
rare
discovery
What
you
say
nephew
according
the
usual
custom
travelers
name
the
stream
after
him

Good
said
And
the
name
Hansbach
Hans
Brook
was
once
agreed
upon

Hans
was
not
bit
more
proud
after
hearing
our
determination
than
was
before
After
having
taken
very
small
modicum
the
welcome
refreshment
had
seated
himself
corner
with
his
usual
imperturbable
gravity

Now
said
not
worth
while
letting
this
water
run
waste

What
the
use
replied
uncle
the
source
from
which
this
river
rises
inexhaustible

Never
mind
continued
let
fill
our
goatskin
and
gourds
and
then
try
stop
the
opening
advice
after
some
hesitation
was
followed
attempted
followed
Hans
picked
all
the
broken
pieces
granite
had
knocked
out
and
using
some
tow
happened
have
about
him
tried
shut
the
fissure
had
made
the
wall
All
did
was
scald
his
hands
The
pressure
was
too
great
and
all
our
attempts
were
utter
failures

evident
remarked
that
the
upper
surface
these
springs
situated
very
great
height
above—as
may
fairly
infer
from
the
great
pressure
the
jet

That
means
doubtful
replied
uncle
this
column
water
about
thirty-two
thousand
feet
high
the
atmospheric
pressure
must
something
enormous
But
new
idea
has
just
struck
And
what
that

Why
much
trouble
close
this
aperture

Because—

hesitated
and
stammered
having
real
reason

When
our
water
bottles
are
empty
are
not
all
sure
that
shall
able
fill
them
observed
uncle

think
that
very
probable

Well
then
let
this
water
run
will
course
naturally
follow
our
track
and
will
serve
guide
and
refresh
think
the
idea
good
one
cried
reply
and
with
this
rivulet
companion
there
further
reason
why
should
not
succeed
our
marvelous
project

boy
said
the
Professor
laughing
after
all
you
are
coming
round

More
than
that
now
confident
ultimate
success

One
moment
nephew
mine
Let
begin
taking
some
hours
repose

had
utterly
forgotten
that
was
night
The
chronometer
however
informed
the
fact
Soon
were
sufficiently
restored
and
refreshed
and
had
all
fallen
into
profound
sleep

CHAPTER
UNDER
THE
OCEAN

the
next
day
had
nearly
forgotten
our
past
sufferings
The
first
sensation
experienced
was
surprise
not
being
thirsty
and
actually
asked
myself
the
reason
The
running
stream
which
flowed
rippling
wavelets
feet
was
the
satisfactory
reply

breakfasted
with
good
appetite
and
then
drank
our
fill
the
excellent
water
felt
myself
quite
new
man
ready
anywhere
uncle
chose
lead
began
think
Why
should
not
man
seriously
convinced
uncle
succeed
with
excellent
guide
worthy
Hans
and
devoted
nephew
myself
These
were
the
brilliant
ideas
which
now
invaded
brain
Had
the
proposition
now
been
made
back
the
summit
Mount
Sneffels
should
have
declined
the
offer
most
indignant
manner

But
fortunately
there
was
question
going
were
about
descend
farther
into
the
interior
the
earth

Let
moving
cried
awakening
the
echoes
the
old
world

resumed
our
march
Thursday
eight
o'clock
the
morning
The
great
granite
tunnel
went
round
sinuous
and
winding
ways
presented
every
now
and
then
sharp
turns
and
fact
all
the
appearance
labyrinth
Its
direction
however
was
general
towards
the
southwest
uncle
made
several
pauses
order
consult
his
compass

The
gallery
now
began
trend
downwards
horizontal
direction
with
about
two
inches
fall
every
furlong
The
murmuring
stream
flowed
quietly
our
feet
could
not
but
compare
some
familiar
spirit
guiding
through
the
earth
and
dabbled
fingers
its
tepid
water
which
sang
like
naiad
progressed
good
humor
began
assume
mythological
character

for
uncle
began
complain
the
horizontal
character
the
road
His
route
found
began
indefinitely
prolonged
instead
sliding
down
the
celestial
ray
according
his
expression

But
had
choice
and
long
our
road
led
towards
the
centre—however
little
progress
made
there
was
reason
complain

Moreover
from
time
time
the
slopes
were
much
greater
the
naiad
sang
more
loudly
and
began
dip
downwards
earnest

yet
however
felt
painful
sensation
had
not
got
over
the
excitement
the
discovery
water

That
day
and
the
next
did
considerable
amount
horizontal
and
relatively
very
little
vertical
traveling

Friday
evening
the
tenth
July
according
our
estimation
ought
have
been
thirty
leagues
the
southeast
Reykjavik
and
about
two
leagues
and
half
deep
now
received
rather
startling
surprise

Under
our
feet
there
opened
horrible
well
uncle
was
delighted
that
actually
clapped
his
hands—as
saw
how
steep
and
sharp
was
the
descent

cried
rapturous
delight
this
will
take
long
way
Look
the
projections
the
rock
Hah
exclaimed
it's
fearful
staircase

Hans
however
who
all
our
troubles
had
never
given
the
ropes
took
care
dispose
them
prevent
any
accidents
Our
descent
then
began
dare
not
call
perilous
descent
for
was
already
too
familiar
with
that
sort
work
look
upon
anything
but
very
ordinary
affair

This
well
was
kind
narrow
opening
the
massive
granite
the
kind
known
fissure
The
contraction
the
terrestrial
scaffolding
when
suddenly
cooled
had
been
evidently
the
cause
had
ever
served
former
times
kind
funnel
through
which
passed
the
eruptive
masses
vomited
Sneffels
was
loss
explain
how
had
left
mark
were
fact
descending
spiral
something
like
those
winding
staircases
use
modern
houses

were
compelled
every
quarter
hour
thereabouts
sit
down
order
rest
our
legs
Our
calves
ached
then
seated
ourselves
some
projecting
rock
with
our
legs
hanging
over
and
gossiped
while
ate
mouthful—drinking
still
from
the
pleasantly
warm
running
stream
which
had
not
deserted
scarcely
necessary
say
that
this
curiously
shaped
fissure
the
Hansbach
had
become
cascade
the
detriment
its
size
was
still
however
sufficient
and
more
for
our
wants
Besides
knew
that
soon
the
declivity
ceased
abrupt
the
stream
must
resume
its
peaceful
course
this
moment
reminded
uncle
his
impatience
and
rage
while
when
flowed
more
peacefully
pictured
myself
the
placidity
the
Icelandic
guide

During
the
whole
two
days
the
sixth
and
seventh
July
followed
the
extraordinary
spiral
staircase
the
fissure
penetrating
two
leagues
farther
into
the
crust
the
earth
which
put
five
leagues
below
the
level
the
sea
the
eighth
however
twelve
o'clock
the
day
the
fissure
suddenly
assumed
much
more
gentle
slope
still
trending
southeast
direction

The
road
now
became
comparatively
easy
and
the
same
time
dreadfully
monotonous
would
have
been
difficult
for
matters
have
turned
out
otherwise
Our
peculiar
journey
had
chance
being
diversified
landscape
and
scenery
all
events
such
was
idea

length
Wednesday
the
fifteenth
were
actually
seven
leagues
twenty-one
miles
below
the
surface
the
earth
and
fifty
leagues
distant
from
the
mountain
Sneffels
Though
the
truth
told
were
very
tired
our
health
had
resisted
all
suffering
and
was
most
satisfactory
state
Our
traveler's
box
medicaments
had
not
even
been
opened

uncle
was
careful
note
every
hour
the
indications
the
compass
the
manometer
and
the
thermometer
all
which
afterwards
published
his
elaborate
philosophical
and
scientific
account
our
remarkable
voyage
was
therefore
able
give
exact
relation
the
situation
When
therefore
informed
that
were
fifty
leagues
horizontal
direction
distant
from
our
starting
point
could
not
suppress
loud
exclamation

What
the
matter
now
cried
uncle

Nothing
very
important
only
idea
has
entered
head
was
reply

Well
out
with
boy

opinion
that
your
calculations
are
correct
are
longer
under
Iceland

you
think
can
very
easily
find
out
replied
pulling
out
map
and
compasses

You
see
said
after
careful
measurement
that
not
mistaken
are
far
beyond
Cape
Portland
and
those
fifty
leagues
the
southeast
will
take
into
the
open
sea

Under
the
open
sea
cried
uncle
rubbing
his
hands
with
delighted
air

Yes
cried
doubt
old
Ocean
flows
over
our
heads

Well
dear
boy
what
can
more
natural
you
not
know
that
the
neighborhood
Newcastle
there
are
coal
mines
which
have
been
worked
far
out
under
the
sea

Now
worthy
uncle
the
Professor
doubt
regarded
this
discovery
very
simple
fact
but
the
idea
was
means
pleasant
one
And
yet
when
one
came
think
the
matter
over
seriously
what
mattered
whether
the
plains
and
mountains
Iceland
were
suspended
over
our
devoted
heads
the
mighty
billows
the
Atlantic
Ocean
The
whole
question
rested
the
solidity

However
soon

now
running
down
and
still
always

kept
going

and

Mother
Earth

Three
days
later
the
eighteenth
day
July
Saturday
reached
kind
vast
grotto
uncle
here
paid
Hans
his
usual
rix-dollars
and
was
decided
that
the
next
day
should
day
rest

CHAPTER
SUNDAY
BELOW
GROUND

Awoke
Sunday
morning
without
any
sense
hurry
and
bustle
attendant
immediate
departure
Though
the
day
devoted
repose
and
reflection
was
spent
under
such
strange
circumstances
and
wonderful
place
the
idea
was
pleasant
one
Besides
all
began
get
used
this
kind
existence
had
almost
ceased
think
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
the
trees
houses
and
towns
fact
about
any
terrestrial
necessities
our
peculiar
position
were
far
above
such
reflections

The
grotto
was
vast
and
magnificent
hall
Along
its
granitic
soil
the
stream
flowed
placidly
and
pleasantly
great
distance
was
now
from
its
fiery
source
that
its
water
was
scarcely
lukewarm
and
could
drunk
without
delay
difficulty

After
frugal
breakfast
the
Professor
made
his
mind
devote
some
hours
putting
his
notes
and
calculations
order

the
first
place
said
have
good
many

and
prove

that

the

expedition

That
would
indeed
curious
work
Uncle
but
can
you
make
your
observations
with
anything
like
certainty
and
precision

can
have
never
any
occasion
failed

with
great
care

angles
and
slopes
certain
having
made

Take
the

looked
the
instrument
with
care

East
one
quarter
southeast

Very
good
resumed
the
Professor
noting
the
observation
and
going
through
some
rapid
calculations
make
out
that
have
journeyed
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
point
our
departure

Then
the
mighty
waves
the
Atlantic
are
rolling
over
our
heads

Certainly

And
this
very
moment
possible
that
fierce
tempests
are
raging
above
and
that
men
and
ships
are
battling
against
the
angry
blasts
just
over
our
heads

quite
within
the
range
possibility
rejoined
uncle
smiling

And
that
whales
are
playing
shoals
thrashing

bottom

sea

roof

adamantine
prison

But
return
our
calculations
are
the
southeast
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
base
Sneffels
and
according
preceding
notes
think
have
gone
sixteen
leagues

Sixteen
leagues—fifty
miles
cried

sure
But
that
the
extreme
limit
allowed

referring

studies

contravene
that
assertion
was
his
quiet
answer

And

according
all
known
laws

Reaumur

There
should
be—you
say
boy

which
case
this
granite
would
not
exist
but
state
fusion

But
you
perceive
boy
that
not
and
that
facts
usual
are
very
stubborn
things
overruling
all
theories

forced

the
evidence
senses
but
nevertheless
very
much
surprised

What
heat
does
the
thermometer
really
indicate
continued
the
philosopher

Twenty-seven

According

and

him
Have
you
any

this
statement

Had
chosen

have
said

the
theory
Humphry

still
held
out
for
the
theory
proportional

heat
though
did
not
feel
was
far
more
willing
allow
that
this
chimney
extinct
volcano
was
covered
lava
kind
refractory
heat—in
fact
bad
conductor—which
did
not
allow
the
great
increase
temperature
percolate
through
its
sides
The
hot
water
jet
supported
view
the
matter

But
without
entering
long
and
useless
discussion
seeking
for
new
arguments
controvert
uncle
contented
myself
with
taking
facts
they
were

Well
sir
take
for
granted
that
all
your
calculations
are
correct
but
allow
draw
from
them
rigorous
and
definite
conclusion

boy—have

uncle
goodhumoredly

now

Now

Exactly

Now

the

that
about

years

The
Professor
folded
his
arms
listened
but
did
not
speak

Without
counting
that
vertical
descent
sixteen

eighty-five

must
therefore

Bother

uncle

Now
then
explained

the
manometer
What
does
that

Very
good
You
see
then
that
descending
slowly
and
gradually

Well

But
then
Uncle
ventured
mildly

Yes—according

however

that

cried
uncle
with

gravity

And
when

asked
with
natural
anxiety

Well
lower

the
density

become
even

Then
how
shall

make
our
way
through
this
atmospheric
fog

Well
worthy
nephew
must
ballast
ourselves
filling
our
pockets
with
stones
said
Professor
Hardwigg

Faith
Uncle
you
have
answer
for
everything
was
only
reply

began
feel
that
was
unwise
any
farther
into
the
wide
field
hypotheses
for
should
certainly
have
revived
some
difficulty
rather
impossibility
that
would
have
enraged
the
Professor

was
evident
nevertheless
that
the
air
under
pressure
which
might
multiplied
thousands
atmospheres
would
end
becoming
perfectly
solid
and
that
then
admitting
our
bodies
resisted
the
pressure
should
have
stop
spite
all
the
reasonings
the
world
Facts
overcome
all
arguments

But
thought
best
not
urge
this
argument
uncle
would
simply
have
quoted
the
example
Saknussemm
Supposing
the
learned
Icelander's
journey
ever
really
have
taken
place—there
was
one
simple
answer
made:

the
sixteenth
century
neither
the
barometer
nor
the
manometer
had
been
invented—how
then
could
Saknussemm
have
been
able
discover
when
did
reach
the
centre
the
earth

This
unanswerable
and
learned
objection
however
kept
myself
and
bracing
courage
awaited
the
course
events—little
aware
how
adventurous
yet
were
the
incidents
our
remarkable
journey

The
rest
this
day
leisure
and
repose
was
spent
calculation
and
conversation
made
point
agree
with
the
Professor
everything
but
envied
the
perfect
indifference
Hans
who
without
taking
any
such
trouble
about
the
cause
and
effect
went
blindly
onwards
wherever
destiny
chose
lead
him

ALONE

must
all
truth
confessed
things
yet
had
gone
well
and
should
have
acted
bad

have
complained
the
true
medium
our
difficulties
did
not
increase
was
within
the
range
possibility
that
might
ultimately
reach
the
end
our
journey
Then
what
glory

ours
began
the
newly
aroused
ardor
soul
speak
enthusiastically
the
Professor
Well
was
serious
The
whole
state
which
existed
was
mystery—and
was
impossible
know
whether
not
was
earnest

For
several
days
after
our
memorable
halt
the
slopes
became
more
rapid—some
were
even
most
frightful
character—almost
vertical
that
were
forever
going
down
into
the
solid
interior
mass
During
some
days
actually
descended
league
and
half
even
two
leagues
towards
the
centre
the
earth
The
descents
were
sufficiently
perilous
and
while
were
engaged
them
learned
fully
appreciate
the
marvelous
coolness
our
guide
Hans
Without
him
should
have
been
wholly
lost
The
grave
and
impassible
Icelander
devoted
himself
with
the
most
incomprehensible
sang-froid
and
ease
and
thanks
him
many
dangerous
pass
was
got
over
where
but
for
him
should
inevitably
have
stuck
fast

His
silence
increased
every
day
think
that
began
influenced
this
peculiar
trait
his
character
certain
that
the
inanimate
objects
which
you
are
surrounded

action
the
brain
must
that
man
who
shuts
himself
between
four
walls
must
lose
the
faculty
associating
ideas
and
words
How
many
persons
condemned
the
horrors
solitary
confinement
have
gone
mad—simply
because
the
thinking
faculties
have
lain
dormant

During
the
two
weeks
that
followed
our
last
interesting
conversation
there
occurred
nothing
worthy
being
especially
recorded

have
while
writing
these
memoirs
taxed
memory
vain
for
one
incident
travel
during
this
particular
period

But
the
next
event
related
terrible
indeed
Its
very
memory
even
now
makes
soul
shudder
and
blood
run
cold

was
the
seventh
August
Our
constant
and
successive
descents
had
taken
quite
thirty
leagues
into
the
interior
the
earth
that
say
that
there
were
above
thirty
leagues
nearly
hundred
miles
rocks
and
oceans
and
continents
and
towns
say
nothing
living
inhabitants
were
southeasterly
direction
about
two
hundred
leagues
from
Iceland

that
memorable
day
the
tunnel
had
begun
assume
almost
horizontal
course

was
this
occasion
walking

uncle
had
charge
one
the
Ruhmkorff
coils
had
possession
the
other
means
its
light
was
busy
examining
the
different
layers
granite
was
completely
absorbed
work

Suddenly
halting
and
turning
round
found
that
was
alone

Well
thought
myself
have
certainly
been
walking
too
fast—or
else
Hans
and
uncle
have
stopped
rest
The
best
thing
can
back
and
find
them
Luckily
there
very
little
ascent
tire
accordingly
retraced
steps
and
while
doing
walked
for
least
quarter
hour
Rather
uneasy
paused
and
looked
eagerly
around
Not
living
soul
called
aloud
reply
voice
was
lost
amid
the
myriad
cavernous
echoes
aroused

began
for
the
first
time
feel
seriously
uneasy
cold
shiver
shook
whole
body
and
perspiration
chill
and
terrible
burst
upon
skin

aloud

There
can
doubt
that

There

two
roads
certain
that
was
considerably
ahead
all
have
back

Having
come
this
determination
ascended
the
tunnel
for
least
half
hour
unable
decide
had
ever
seen
certain
landmarks
before
Every
now
and
then
paused
discover
any
loud
appeal
was
made
well
knowing
that
that
dense
and
intensified
atmosphere
should
hear
long
way
off
But
The
most
extraordinary
silence
reigned
this
immense
gallery
Only
the
echoes
own
footsteps
could
heard

last
stopped
could
scarcely
realize
the
fact
isolation
was
quite
willing
think
that
had
made
mistake
but
not
that
was
lost
had
made
mistake
might
find
way
lost—I
shuddered
think
Come
come
said
myself
since
there
only
one
road
and
they
must
come
shall
last
meet
All
have
still
upwards
Perhaps
however
not
seeing
and
forgetting
was
ahead
they
may
have
gone
back
search
Still
even
this
case
make
haste
shall
get
them
There
can
doubt
about
the
matter

But
spoke
these
last
words
aloud
would
have
been
quite
clear
any
listener—had
there
been
one—that
was
means
convinced
the
fact
Moreover
order
associate
together
these
simple
ideas
and
reunite
them
under
the
form
reasoning
required
some
time
could
not
all
once
bring
brain
think

Then
another
dread
doubt
fell
upon
soul
After
all
was
ahead
course
was
Hans
was
doubt
following
behind
preceded
uncle
perfectly
recollected
his
having
stopped
for
moment
strap
his
baggage
his
shoulder
now
remembered
this
trifling
detail
was
believe
just
that
very
moment
that
had
determined
continue
route

Again
thought
reasoning
calmly
was
possible
there
another
sure
means
not
losing
way
thread
guide
through
the
labyrinthine
subterraneous
retreat—one
which
had
forgotten—my
faithful
river

This
course
reasoning
roused
drooping
spirits
and
resolved
resume
journey
without
further
delay
time
was
lost

was
this
moment
that
had
reason
bless
the
thoughtfulness
uncle
when
refused
allow
the
eider
hunter
close
the
orifices
the
hot
spring—that
small
fissure
the
great
mass
granite
This
beneficent
spring
after
having
saved
from
thirst
during
many
days
would
now
enable
regain
the
right
road

Having
come
this
mental
decision
made
mind
before
started
upwards
that
ablution
would
certainly
great
deal
good

stopped
plunge
hands
and
forehead

pleasant

consolation

Conceive

influence
terrible
hallucination
saw
all
the
incidents
our
journey
pass
before

The

but
reason
with
calmness
and

what

was
there

take
back
the

and

too

those

above

Who

Insensate

Uncle

This
was
the
only
word
reproach
which
came
lips
for
thoroughly
understood
how
deeply
and
sorrowfully
the
worthy
Professor
would
regret
loss
and
how
his
turn
would
patiently
seek
for
When
last
began
resign
myself
the
fact
that
further
aid
was
expected
from
man
and
knowing
that
was
utterly
powerless
anything
for
own
salvation
kneeled
with
earnest
fervor
and
asked
assistance
from
Heaven
The
remembrance

childhood
the
memory

only

came
welling
forth
from

And
little
had
right
remembered
Him
whom
had
forgotten
the
hour

and
whom
tardily
invoked
prayed
earnestly
and
sincerely

This
renewal
youthful
faith
brought
about
much
greater
amount
calm
and
was
enabled
concentrate
all
strength
and
intelligence
the
terrible
realities
unprecedented
situation

had
about
that
which
had
first
wholly
forgotten—three
days'
provisions
Moreover
water
bottle
was
quite
full
Nevertheless
the
one
thing
which
was
impossible
was
remain
alone
Try
find
companions
must
any
price
But
which
course
should
take
Should
upwards
again
descend
Doubtless
was
right
retrace
steps

doing
this
with
care
and
coolness
must
reach
the
point
where
had
turned
away
from
the
rippling
stream
must
find
the
fatal
bifurcation
fork
Once
this
spot
once

river

could
all
events
regain
the
awful
crater
Mount
Sneffels
Why
had
not
thought
this
before
This
last
was
reasonable
hope
safety
The
most
important
thing
then
done
was
discover
the
bed
the
Hansbach

After
slight
meal
and
draught
water
rose
like
giant
refreshed
Leaning
heavily
pole
began
the
ascent
the
gallery
The
slope
was
very
rapid
and
rather
difficult
But
advanced
hopefully
and
carefully
like
man
who
last
making
his
way
out
forest
and
knows
there
only
one
road
follow

During
one
whole
hour
nothing
happened
check
progress
advanced
tried
recollect
the
shape
the
tunnel—to
recall
memory
certain
projections
rocks—to
persuade
myself
that
had
followed
certain
winding
routes
before
But
one
particular
sign
could
bring
mind
and
was
soon
forced
allow
that
this
gallery
would
never
take
back
the
point
which
had
separated
myself
from
companions
was
absolutely
without
issue—a
mere
blind
alley
the
earth

The
moment
length
came
when
facing
the
solid
rock
knew
fate
and
fell
inanimate
the
arid
floor

describe
the
horrible
state
despair
and
fear
into
which
then
fell
would
now
vain
and
impossible
last
hope
the
courage
which
had
sustained
drooped
before
the
sight
this
pitiless
granite
rock

Lost
vast
labyrinth
the
sinuosities
which
spread
every
direction
without
guide
clue

vain
and
useless

All
that
remained
was

down

lie
down
and

most
cruel
and
horrible
deaths

the
idea
came
into
head
that
one
day
perhaps
when
fossil

were

below

the
earth
might
give
rise
solemn
and

aloud
but
hoarse
hollow
and
inarticulate

could
make
themselves

Its

paler
and

With
strange
sense
resignation
and
despair
watched
the
luminous
current
the
coil
getting
less
and
less
procession
shadows
moved
flashing
along
the
granite
wall
scarcely
dared
lower

fearing

the
last
spark
this
fugitive
light
Every
instant
seemed
that
was
about

was
now

lost

effects

against

extreme
Madness

not
what

began
run
fly
rushing
haphazard
this
inextricable
labyrinth
always
going
downwards
running
wildly
underneath
the
terrestrial
crust
like
inhabitant
the
subterranean
furnaces
screaming
roaring
howling
until
bruised
the
pointed
rocks
falling
and
picking
myself
all
covered
with
blood
seeking
madly
drink
the
blood
which
dripped
from
torn
features
mad
because
this
blood
only
trickled
over
face
and
watching
always
for
this
horrid
wall
which
ever
presented
the
fearful
obstacle
against
which
could
not
dash
head

Where
was
going
was
impossible
say
was
perfectly
ignorant
the
matter

Several
hours
passed
this
way
After
long
time
having
utterly
exhausted
strength
fell
heavy
inert
mass
along
the
side
the
tunnel
and
lost
consciousness

CHAPTER
THE
WHISPERING
GALLERY

When
last
came
back
sense
life
and
being
face
was
wet
but
wet
soon
knew
with
tears
How
long
this
state
insensibility
lasted
quite
impossible
for
now
say
had
means
left
taking
any
account
time
Never
since
the
creation
the
world
had
such
solitude
mine
existed
was
completely
abandoned

After
fall
lost
much
blood
felt
myself
flooded
with
the
life-giving
liquid
first
sensation
was
perhaps
natural
one
Why
was
not
dead
Because
was
alive
there
was
something
left
tried
make
mind
think
longer
far
was
able
drove
away
all
ideas
and
utterly
overcome
pain
and
grief
crouched
against
the
granite
wall

just
commenced
feel
the
fainting
coming
again
and
the
sensation
that
this
was
the
last
struggle
before
complete
annihilation—when
sudden
violent
uproar
reached
ears
had
some
resemblance
the
prolonged
rumbling
voice
thunder
and
clearly
distinguished
sonorous
voices
lost
one
after
the
other
the
distant
depths
the
gulf

Whence
came
this
noise
Naturally
was
supposed
from
new
phenomena
which
were
taking
place
the
bosom
the
solid
mass
Mother
Earth
The
explosion
some
gaseous
vapors
the
fall
some
solid
the
granitic
other
rock

Again
listened
with
deep
attention
was
extremely
anxious
hear
this
strange
and
inexplicable
sound
was
likely
renewed
whole
quarter
hour
elapsed
painful
expectation
Deep
and
solemn
silence
reigned
the
tunnel
still
that
could
hear
the
beatings
own
heart
waited
waited
with
strange
kind
hopefulness

Suddenly
ear
which
leaned
accidentally
against
the
wall
appeared
catch
were
the
faintest
echo
sound
thought
that
heard
vague
incoherent
and
distant
voices
quivered
all
over
with
excitement
and
hope

must
hallucination
cried
cannot
not
true

But
listening
more
attentively
really
did
convince
myself
that
what
heard
was
truly
the
sound
human
voices
make
any
meaning
out
the
sound
however
was
beyond
power
was
too
weak
even
hear
distinctly
Still
was
positive
fact
that
someone
was
speaking
that
was
quite
certain

There
was
moment
fear
dread
fell
upon
soul
that
might
own
words
brought
back
distant
echo
Perhaps
without
knowing
might
have
been
crying
aloud
resolutely
closed
lips
and
once
more
placed
ear
the
huge
granite
wall

Yes
for
certain
was
truth
the
sound
human
voices

now
the
exercise
great
determination
dragged
myself
along
the
sides
the
cavern
until
reached
point
where
could
hear
more
distinctly
But
though
could
detect
the
sound
could
only
make
out
uncertain
strange
and
incomprehensible
words
They
reached
ear
they
had
been
spoken
low
tone—murmured
were
afar
off

last
made
out
the
word
forlorad
repeated
several
times
tone
betokening
great
mental
anguish
and
sorrow

What
could
this
word
mean
and
who
was
speaking
must
either
uncle
the
guide
Hans
therefore
could
hear
them
they
must
surely
able
hear
Help
cried
the
top
voice
help
dying

then
listened
with
scarcely
breath
panted
for
the
slightest
sound
the
darkness—a
cry
sigh
question
But
silence
reigned
supreme
answer
came
this
way
some
minutes
passed
whole
flood
ideas
flashed
through
mind
began
fear
that
voice
weakened
sickness
and
suffering
could
not
reach
companions
who
were
search
must
they
cried
who
else
could
any
possibility
buried
hundred
miles
below
the
level
the
earth
The
mere
supposition
was
preposterous

began
therefore
listen
again
with
the
most
breathless
attention
moved
ears
along
the
side
the
place
was
found
mathematical
point
were
where
the
voices
appeared
attain
their
maximum
intensity
The
word
forlorad
again
distinctly
reached
ear
Then
came
again
that
rolling
noise
like
thunder
which
had
awakened
out
torpor

begin
understand
said
myself
after
some
little
time
devoted
reflection
not
through
the
solid
mass
that
the
sound
reaches
ears
The
walls
cavernous
retreat
are
solid
granite
and
the
most
fearful
explosion
would
not
make
uproar
enough
penetrate
them
The
sound
must
come
along
the
gallery
itself
The
place
was
must
possess
some
peculiar
acoustic
properties
its
own

Again
listened
and
this
time—yes
this
time—I
heard
name
distinctly
pronounced:
cast
were
into
space

was
uncle
the
Professor
who
was
speaking
was
conversation
with
the
guide
and
the
word
which
had
often
reached
ears
forlorad
was
Danish
expression

Then
understood
all
order
make
myself
heard
too
must
speak
were
along
the
side
the
gallery
which
would
carry
the
sound
voice
just
the
wire
carries
the
electric
fluid
from
point
point

But
there
was
time
lose
companions
were
only
remove
few
feet
from
where
they
stood
the
acoustic
effect
would
over
Whispering
Gallery
would
destroyed
again
therefore
crawled
towards
the
wall
and
said
clearly
and
distinctly
could:

Uncle
Hardwigg

then
awaited
reply

Sound
does
not
possess
the
property
traveling
with
such
extreme
rapidity
Besides
the
density
the
air
that
depth
from
light
and
motion
was
very
far
from
adding
the
rapidity
circulation
Several
seconds
elapsed
which
excited
imagination
appeared
ages
and
these
words
reached
eager
ears
and
moved
wildly
beating
heart:

Harry
boy
that
you

short
delay
between
question
and
answer

Yes—yes

Where
are
you

Lost

And
your
lamp

Out

But
the
guiding
stream

lost

Keep
your
courage
Harry
will
our
best

One
moment
uncle
cried
have
longer
strength
answer
your
questions
But—for
heaven's
sake—do
you—continue—to
speak—to
Absolute
silence
felt
would
annihilation

Keep
your
courage
said
uncle
you
are
weak
not
speak
have
been
searching
for
you
all
directions
both
going
upwards
and
downwards
the
gallery
dear
boy
had
begun
give
over
all
hope—and
you
can
never
know
what
bitter
tears
sorrow
and
regret
have
shed
last
supposing
you
still
the
road
beside
the
Hansbach
again
descended
firing
off
guns
signals
Now
however
that
have
found
you
and
that
our
voices
reach
each
other
may
long
time
before
actually
meet
are
conversing
means
some
extraordinary
acoustic
arrangement
the
labyrinth
But
not
despair
dear
boy
something
gained
even
hear
each
other

While
was
speaking
brain
was
work
reflecting
certain
undefined
hope
vague
and
shapeless
yet
made
heart
beat
wildly
the
first
place
was
absolutely
necessary
for
know
one
thing
once
more
therefore
leaned
head
against
the
wall
which
almost
touched
with
lips
and
again
spoke

Uncle

boy
was
his
answer
after
few
moments

the
utmost
consequence
that
should
know
how
far
are
asunder

That
not
difficult

You
have
your
chronometer
hand
asked

Certainly

Well
take
into
your
hand
Pronounce
name
noting
exactly
the
second
which
you
speak
will
reply
soon
hear
your
words—and
you
will
then
note
exactly
the
moment
which
reply
reaches
you

Very
good
and
the
mean
time
between
question
and
your
answer
will
the
time
occupied
voice
reaching
you

That
exactly
what
mean
Uncle
was
eager
reply

Are
you
ready

Yes

Well
make
ready
about
pronounce
your
name
said
the
Professor

applied
ear
close
the
sides
the
cavernous
gallery
and
soon
the
word
Harry
reached
ear
turned
round
and
placing
lips
the
wall
repeated
the
sound

Forty
seconds
said
uncle
There
has
elapsed
forty
seconds
between
the
two
words
The
sound
therefore
takes
twenty
seconds
ascend
Now
allowing
thousand
and
twenty
feet
for
every
second—we
have
twenty
thousand
four
hundred
feet—a
league
and
half
and
one-eighth

These
words
fell
soul
like
kind
death
knell

league
and
half
muttered
low
and
despairing
voice

shall
got
over
boy
cried
uncle
cheery
tone
depend
But
you
know
whether
ascend
descend
asked
faintly
enough

have
descend
and
will
tell
you
why
You
have
reached
vast
open
space
kind
bare
crossroad
from
which
galleries
diverge
every
direction
That
which
you
are
now
lying
must
necessarily
bring
you
this
point
for
appears
that
all
these
mighty
fissures
these
fractures
the
globe's
interior
radiate
from
the
vast
cavern
which
this
moment
occupy
Rouse
yourself
then
have
courage
and
continue
your
route
Walk
you
can
not
drag
yourself
along—slide
nothing
else
possible
The
slope
must
rather
rapid—and
you
will
find
strong
arms
receive
you
the
end
your
journey
Make
start
like
good
fellow

These
words
served
rouse
some
kind
courage
sinking
frame

Farewell
for
the
present
good
uncle
about
take
departure
soon
start
our
voices
will
cease
commingle
Farewell
then
until
meet
again

Adieu
Harry—until
say
Welcome
Such
were
the
last
words
which
reached
anxious
ears
before
commenced
weary
and
almost
hopeless
journey

This
wonderful
and
surprising
conversation
which
took
place
through
the
vast
mass
the
earth's
labyrinth
these
words
exchanged
the
speakers
being
about
five
miles
apart—ended
with
hopeful
and
pleasant
expressions
breathed
one
more
prayer
Heaven
sent
words
thanksgiving—believing
inmost
heart
that
had
led
the
only
place
where
the
voices
friends
could
reach
ears

This
apparently
astounding
acoustic
mystery
easily
explainable
simple
natural
laws
arose
from
the
conductibility
the
rock
There
are
many
instances
this
singular
propagation
sound
which
are
not
perceptible
its
less
mediate
positions
the
interior
gallery
Paul's
and
amid
the
curious
caverns
Sicily
these
phenomena
are
observable
The
most
marvelous
them
all
known
the
Ear
Dionysius

These
memories
the
past
early
reading
and
studies
came
fresh
thoughts
Moreover
began
reason
that
uncle
and
could
communicate
great
distance
serious
obstacle
could
exist
between
All
had
was
follow
the
direction
whence
the
sound
had
reached
and
logically
putting
must
reach
him
strength
did
not
fail

accordingly
rose
feet
soon
found
however
that
could
not
walk
that
must
drag
myself
along
The
slope
expected
was
very
rapid
but
allowed
myself
slip
down

Soon
the
rapidity
the
descent
began
assume
frightful
proportions
and
menaced
fearful
fall
clutched
the
sides
grasped
projections
rocks
threw
myself
backwards
All
vain
weakness
was
great
could
nothing
save
myself

Suddenly
earth
failed
was
first
launched
into
dark
and
gloomy
void
then
struck
against
the
projecting
asperities
vertical
gallery
perfect
well
head
bounded
against
pointed
rock
and
lost
all
knowledge
existence
far
was
concerned
death
had
claimed
for
his
own

CHAPTER
RAPID
RECOVERY

When
returned
the
consciousness
existence
found
myself
surrounded
kind
semiobscurity
lying
some
thick
and
soft
coverlets
uncle
was
watching—his
eyes
fixed
intently
countenance
grave
expression
his
face
tear
his
eye
the
first
sigh
which
struggled
from
bosom
took
hold
hand
When
saw
eyes
open
and
fix
themselves
upon
his
uttered
loud
cry
joy
lives
lives

Yes
good
uncle
whispered

dear
boy
continued
the
grim
Professor
clasping
his
heart
you
are
saved

was
deeply
and
unaffectedly
touched
the
tone
which
these
words
were
uttered
and
even
more
the
kindly
care
which
accompanied
them
The
Professor
however
was
one
those
men
who
must
severely
tried
order
induce
any
display
affection
gentle
emotion
this
moment
our
friend
Hans
the
guide
joined
saw
hand
that
uncle
and
venture
say
that
taciturn
was
his
eyes
beamed
with
lively
satisfaction

God
dag
said

Good
day
Hans
good
day
replied
hearty
tone
could
assume
and
now
Uncle
that
are
together
tell
where
are
have
lost
all
idea
our
position
everything
else

Tomorrow
Harry
tomorrow
replied
Today
you
are
far
too
weak
Your
head
surrounded
with
bandages
and
poultices
that
must

Sleep
boy
sleep
and
tomorrow
you
will
know
all
that
you
require

But
cried
let
know
what
o'clock
is—what
day
now
eleven
o'clock
night
and
this
once
more
Sunday
now
the
ninth
the
month
August
And
distinctly
prohibit
you
from
asking
any
more
questions
until
the
tenth
the

was
the
truth
were
told
very
weak
indeed
and
eyes
soon
closed
involuntarily
did
require
good
night's
rest
and
went
off
reflecting
the
last
moment
that
perilous
adventure
the
interior
the
earth
total
darkness
had
lasted
four
days

the
morning
the
next
day
awakening
began
look
around
sleeping
place
made
all
our
traveling
bedding
was
charming
grotto
adorned
with
magnificent
stalagmites
glittering
all
the
colors
the
rainbow
the
floor
soft
and
silvery
sand

dim
obscurity
prevailed
torch
lamp
was
lighted
and
yet
certain
unexplained
beams
light
penetrated
from
without
and
made
their
way
through
the
opening
the
beautiful
grotto

moreover
heard
vague
and
indefinite
murmur
like
the
ebb
and
flow
waves
upon
strand
and
sometimes
verily
believed
could
hear
the
sighing
the
wind

began
believe
that
instead
being
awake
must
dreaming
Surely
brain
had
not
been
affected
fall
and
all
that
occurred
during
the
last
twenty-four
hours
was
not
the
frenzied
visions
madness
And
yet
after
some
reflection
trial
faculties
came
the
conclusion
that
could
not
mistaken
Eyes
and
ears
could
not
surely
both
deceive
ray
the
blessed
daylight
said
myself
which
has
penetrated
through
some
mighty
fissure
the
rocks
But
what
the
meaning
this
murmur
waves
this
unmistakable
moaning
the
salt-sea
billows
can
hear
too
plainly
enough
the
whistling
the
wind
But
can
altogether
mistaken
uncle
during
illness
has
but
carried
back
the
surface
the
earth
Has
account
given
his
wondrous
expedition
some
strange
manner
has
come
end

was
puzzling
brain
over
these
and
other
questions
when
the
Professor
joined
Good
day
Harry
cried
joyous
tone
fancy
you
are
quite
well

very
much
better
replied
actually
sitting
bed

knew
that
would
the
end
you
slept
both
soundly
and
tranquilly
Hans
and
have
each
taken
turn
watch
and
every
hour
have
seen
visible
signs
amelioration

You
must
right
Uncle
was
reply
for
feel
could
justice
any
meal
you
could
put
before
You
shall
eat
boy
you
shall
eat
The
fever
has
left
you
Our
excellent
friend
Hans
has
rubbed
your
wounds
and
bruises
with
know
not
what
ointment
which
the
Icelanders
alone
possess
the
secret
And
they
have
healed
your
bruises
the
most
marvelous
manner
he's
wise
fellow
Master
Hans

While
was
speaking
uncle
was
placing
before
several
articles
food
which
despite
his
earnest
injunctions
readily
devoured
soon
the
first
rage
hunger
was
appeased
overwhelmed
him
with
questions
which
now
longer
hesitated
give
answers

then
learned
for
the
first
time
that
providential
fall
had
brought
the
bottom
almost
perpendicular
gallery
came
down
amidst
perfect
shower
stones
the
least
which
falling
would
have
crushed
death
they
came
the
conclusion
that
had
carried
with
entire
dislocated
rock
Riding
were
this
terrible
chariot
was
cast
headlong
into
uncle's
arms
And
into
them
fell
insensible
and
covered
with
blood

indeed
miracle
was
the
Professor's
final
remark
that
you
were
not
killed
thousand
times
over
But
let
take
care
never
separate
for
surely
should
risk
never
meeting
again

Let
take
care
never
again
separate

These
words
fell
with
sort
chill
upon
heart
The
journey
then
was
not
over
looked
uncle
with
surprise
and
astonishment
uncle
after
instant's
examination
countenance
said:
What
the
matter
Harry

want
ask
you
very
serious
question
You
say
that
all
right
health

Certainly
you
are

And
all
limbs
are
sound
and
capable
new
exertion
asked

Most
undoubtedly

But
what
about
head
was
next
anxious
question

Well
your
head
except
that
you
have
one
two
contusions
exactly
where
ought
be—on
your
shoulders
said
uncle
laughing

Well
own
opinion
that
head
not
exactly
right
fact
believe
myself
slightly
delirious

What
makes
you
think
will
explain
why
fancy
have
lost
senses
cried
Have
not
returned
the
surface
Mother
Earth

Certainly
not

Then
truly
must
mad
for
not
see
the
light
day
not
hear
the
whistling
the
wind
and
can
not
distinguish
the
wash
great
sea

And
that
all
that
makes
you
uneasy
said
uncle
with
smile

Can
you
explain

will
not
make
any
attempt
explain
for
the
whole
matter
utterly
inexplicable
But
you
shall
see
and
judge
for
yourself
You
will
then
find
that
geological
science
yet
its
infancy—and
that
are
doomed
enlighten
the
world

Let
advance
then
cried
eagerly
longer
able
restrain
curiosity

Wait
moment
dear
Harry
responded
you
must
take
precautions
after
your
illness
before
going
into
the
open
air

The
open
air

Yes
boy
have
warn
you
that
the
wind
rather
violent—and
have
wish
for
you
expose
yourself
without
necessary
precautions

But
beg
assure
you
that
perfectly
recovered
from
illness

Have
just
little
patience
boy
relapse
would
inconvenient
all
parties
have
time
lose—as
our
approaching
sea
voyage
may
long
duration

Sea
voyage
cried
more
bewildered
than
ever

Yes
You
must
take
another
day's
rest
and
shall
ready
board
tomorrow
replied
uncle
with
peculiar
smile

The
words

how
Had

Was

curiosity
was
worked
the
very
highest
pitch
uncle
made
vain
attempts
restrain
When
last
however
discovered
that
feverish
impatience
would
more
harm
than
good—and
that
the
satisfaction
wishes
could
alone
restore
calm
state

gave

dressed
myself
rapidly—and

grotto

CHAPTER
THE
CENTRAL
SEA

first
saw
absolutely
nothing
eyes
wholly
unused
the
effulgence
light
could
not
bear
the
sudden
brightness
and
was
compelled
close
them
When
was
able
reopen
them
stood
still
far
more
stupefied
than
astonished
Not
all
the
wildest
effects
imagination
could
have
conjured
such
scene
The
sea—the
sea
cried

Yes
replied
uncle
tone
pardonable
pride
the
Central
Sea
future
navigator
will
deny
the
fact
having
discovered
and
hence
acquiring
right
giving
name

was
quite
true
vast
limitless
expanse
water
the
end
lake
not
ocean
spread
before
until
was
lost
the
distance
The
shore
which
was
very
much
indented
consisted
beautiful
soft
golden
sand
mixed
with
small
shells
the
long-deserted
home
some
the
creatures
past
age
The
waves
broke
incessantly—and
with
peculiarly
sonorous
murmur
found
underground
localities
slight
frothy
flake
arose
the
wind
blew
along
the
pellucid
waters
and
many
dash
spray
was
blown
into
face
The
mighty
superstructure
rock
which
rose
above
inconceivable
height
left
only
narrow
opening—but
where
stood
there
was
large
margin
strand
all
sides
were
capes
and
promontories
and
enormous
cliffs
partially
worn
the
eternal
breaking
the
waves
through
countless
ages
And
gazed
from
side
side
the
mighty
rocks
faded
away
like
fleecy
film
cloud

was
reality
ocean
with
all
the
usual
characteristics
inland
sea
only
horribly
wild—so
rigid
cold
and
savage

One
thing
startled
and
puzzled
greatly
How
was
that
was
able
look
upon
that
vast
sheet
water
instead
being
plunged
utter
darkness
The
vast
landscape
before
was
lit
like
day
But
there
was
wanting
the
dazzling
brilliancy
the
splendid
irradiation
the
sun
the
pale
cold
illumination
the
moon
the
brightness
the
stars
The
illuminating
power
this
subterranean
region
from
its
trembling
and
Rickering
character
its
clear
dry
whiteness
the
very
slight
elevation
its
temperature
its
great
superiority
that
the
moon
was
evidently
electric
something
the
nature
the
aurora
borealis
only
that
its
phenomena
were
constant
and
able
light
the
whole
the
ocean
cavern

The
tremendous
vault
above
our
heads
the
sky
speak
appeared
composed
conglomeration
nebulous
vapors
constant
motion
should
originally
have
supposed
that
under
such
atmospheric
pressure
must
exist
that
place
the
evaporation
water
could
not
really
take
place
and
yet
from
the
action
some
physical
law
which
escaped
memory
there
were
heavy
and
dense
clouds
rolling
along
that
mighty
vault
partially
concealing
the
roof
Electric
currents
produced
astonishing
play
light
and
shade
the
distance
especially
around
the
heavier
clouds
Deep
shadows
were
cast
beneath
and
then
suddenly
between
two
clouds
there
would
come
ray
unusual
beauty
and
remarkable
intensity
And
yet
was
not
like
the
sun
for
gave
heat

The
effect
was
sad
and
excruciatingly
melancholy
Instead
noble
firmament
blue
studded
with
stars
there
was
above
heavy
roof
granite
which
seemed
crush
Gazing
around
began
think
the
theory
the
English
captain
who
compared
the
earth
vast
hollow
sphere

interior
which
the
air
retained

view

see
that

Looking

The

the
word

order
give
idea
the
place
cannot
describe
its
awful
grandeur
human
language

convey
idea
its
savage
sublimity
Whether
this
singular
vacuum
had
had
not
been
caused
the
sudden
cooling
the
earth
when
state

could
not
say
had
read
most

The

were

that
which
stood
speechless
admiration
with
its
vapory
clouds
its
electric
light
and
the
mighty
ocean
slumbering
its
bosom
Imagination

alone
give

Words
were
utterly

upon

for

such
new
sensations
would
have
required
the
coinage
new
words—and
here
feeble
brain
found
itself
wholly
fault
looked

reflected

stupefaction
not
altogether
unmingled
with
fear

The
unexpected
spectacle
restored
some
color
pallid
cheeks
seemed
actually
getting
better
under
the
influence
this
novelty
Moreover
the
vivacity
the
dense
atmosphere
reanimated

inflating
lungs
with
unaccustomed
oxygen

will
readily
conceived
that
after
imprisonment
forty-seven
days

and
miserable
tunnel
was
with
infinite
delight
that
breathed
this
saline
air
was
like
the
genial
reviving
influence
the
salt
sea
waves

uncle
had
already
got
over
the
first
surprise

With
the
Latin
poet
Horace
his
idea
was
that—

Not
admire
all
the
art
know

make
man
happy
and
keep
him
Well
said
after
giving
time
thoroughly
appreciate
the
marvels
this
underground
sea
you
feel
strong
enough
walk
and
down

Certainly
was
ready
answer
nothing
would
give
greater
pleasure

Well
then
boy
said
lean
arm
and
will
stroll
along
the
beach

accepted
his
offer
eagerly
and
began
walk
along
the
shores
this
extraordinary
lake
our
left
were
abrupt
rocks
piled
one
upon
the
other—a
stupendous
titanic
pile
down
their
sides
leaped
innumerable
cascades
which
last
becoming
limpid
and
murmuring
streams
were
lost
the
waters
the
lake
Light
vapors
which
rose
here
and
there
and
floated
fleecy
clouds
from
rock
rock
indicated
hot
springs
which
also
poured
their
superfluity
into
the
vast
reservoir
our
feet

Among
them
recognized
our
old
and
faithful
stream
the
Hansbach
which
lost
that
wild
basin
seemed
had
been
flowing
since
the
creation
the
world

shall
miss
our
excellent
friend
remarked
with
deep
sigh

Bah
said
uncle
testily
what
matters
That
another
all
the
same

thought
the
remark
ungrateful
and
felt
almost
inclined
say
but
forbore

this
moment
attention
was
attracted
unexpected
spectacle
After
had
gone
about
five
hundred
yards
suddenly
turned
steep
promontory
and
found
ourselves
close
lofty
forest
consisted
straight
trunks
with
tufted
tops
shape
like
parasols
The
air
seemed
have
effect
upon
these
trees—which
spite
tolerable
breeze
remained
still
and
motionless
they
had
been
petrified

hastened
forward
could
find
name
for
these
singular
formations
Did
they
not
belong
the
two
thousand
and
more
known
trees—or
were
make
the
discovery
new
growth
means
When
last
reached
the
forest
and
stood
beneath
the
trees
surprise
gave
way
admiration

truth
was
simply
the
presence
very
ordinary
product
the
earth
singular
and
gigantic
proportions
uncle
unhesitatingly
called
them
their
real
names

only
said
his
coolest
manner
forest
mushrooms

close
examination
found
that
was
not
mistaken
Judge
the
development
attained
this
product
damp
hot
soils
had
heard
that
the
Lycoperdon
giganteum
reaches
nine
feet
circumference
but
here
were
white
mushrooms
nearly
forty
feet
high
and
with
tops
equal
dimensions
They
grew
countless
thousands—the
light
could
not
make
its
way
through
their
massive
substance
and
beneath
them
reigned
gloomy
and
mystic
darkness

Still
wished
forward
The
cold
the
shades
this
singular
forest
was
intense
For
nearly
hour
wandered
about
this
visible
darkness
length
left
the
spot
and
once
more
returned
the
shores
the
lake
light
and
comparative
warmth

But
the
amazing
vegetation
subterraneous
land
was
not
confined
gigantic
mushrooms
New
wonders
awaited
every
step
had
not
gone
many
hundred
yards
when
came
upon
mighty
group
other
trees
with
discolored
leaves—the
common
humble
trees
Mother
Earth
exorbitant
and
phenomenal
size:
lycopods
hundred
feet
high
flowering
ferns
tall
pines
gigantic
grasses

Astonishing

cried
uncle

Behold

Look

Harry

uncle's

was

now
excusable

You

Doubtless

And

nephew
said
uncle
noticing
that
suddenly
came
full
stop

not
understand
the
presence
such
beasts
granite
caverns
however
vast
and
prodigious
was
reply

Why
not
said
uncle
with
very
much
his
old
professional
impatience

Because

primitive
age

have
listened
you
earnestly
and
with
patience
Harry
and
have
simple
and
clear
answer
your
objections:
and
that
that
this
itself

How
can
that

The

that

took

those
days
and
that

cast
into

Quite
possible
dryly
remarked
But
Uncle
these
antediluvian

formerly
lived
these
subterranean
regions
what
more
likely
than
that
one
these
monsters

moment

spoke
looked
keenly
around
examining
with
care
every
point

but
nothing

these
deserted
shores

now
felt
rather
fatigued
and
told
uncle
The
walk
and
excitement
were
too
much
for

therefore
seated
myself

rolls
looked
round
bay
formed
projections
vast
granitic
rocks
the
extreme
end
was
little
port
protected
huge
pyramids
stones
brig
and
three
four
schooners
might
have
lain
there
with
perfect
ease
natural
did
seem
that
every
minute
imagination
induced
expect
vessel
coming
out
under
all
sail
and
making
for
the
open
sea
under
the
influence
warm
southerly
breeze

But
the
fantastic
illusion
never
lasted
more
than
minute
were
the
only
living
creatures
this
subterranean
world

During
certain
periods
there
was
utter
cessation
wind
when
silence
deeper
more
terrible
than
the
silence
the
desert
fell
upon
these
solitary
and
arid
rocks—and
seemed
hang
like
leaden
weight
upon
the
waters
this
singular
ocean
sought
amid
the
awful
stillness
penetrate
through
the
distant
fog
tear
down
the
veil
which
concealed
the
mysterious
distance
What
unspoken
words
were
murmured
trembling
lips—what
questions
did
wish
ask
and
did
not
Where
did
this
sea
end—to
what
did
lead
Should
ever
able
examine
its
distant
shores

But
uncle
had
doubts
about
the
matter
was
convinced
that
our
enterprise
would
the
end
successful
For
part
was
state
painful
indecision—I
desired
embark
the
journey
and
succeed
and
still
feared
the
result

After
had
passed
hour
more
silent
contemplation
the
wondrous
spectacle
rose
and
went
down
towards
the
bank
our
way
the
grotto
which
was
not
sorry
gain
After
slight
repast
sought
refuge
slumber
and
length
after
many
and
tedious
struggles
sleep
came
over
weary
eyes

CHAPTER
LAUNCHING
THE
RAFT

the
morning
the
next
day
great
surprise
awoke
completely
restored
thought
bath
would
delightful
after
long
illness
and
sufferings
soon
after
rising
went
and
plunged
into
the
waters
this
new
Mediterranean
The
bath
was
cool
fresh
and
invigorating

came
back
breakfast
with
excellent
appetite
Hans
our
worthy
guide
thoroughly
understood
how
cook
such
eatables
were
able
provide
had
both
fire
and
water
discretion
that
was
enabled
slightly
vary
the
weary
monotony
our
ordinary
repast

Our
morning
meal
was
like
capital
English
breakfast
with
coffee
way
windup
And
never
had
this
delicious
beverage
been
welcome
and
refreshing

uncle
had
sufficient
regard
for
state
health
not
interrupt
the
enjoyment
the
meal
but
was
evidently
delighted
when
had
finished

Now
then
said
come
with
the
height
the
tide
and
anxious
study
its
curious
phenomena

What'
cried
rising
astonishment
did
you
say
the
tide
Uncle

Certainly
did

You
not
mean
say
replied
tone
respectful
doubt
that
the
influence
the
sun
and
moon
felt
here
below

And
pray
why
not
Are
not
all
bodies
influenced
the
law
universal
attraction
Why
should
this
vast
underground
sea
exempt
from
the
general
law
the
rule
the
universe
Besides
there
nothing
like
that
which
proved
and
demonstrated
Despite
the
great
atmospheric
pressure
down
here
you
will
notice
that
this
inland
sea
rises
and
falls
with
much
regularity
the
Atlantic
itself

uncle
spoke
reached
the
sandy
shore
and
saw
and
heard
the
waves
breaking
monotonously
the
beach
They
were
evidently
rising

This
truly
the
flood
cried
looking
the
water
feet

Yes
excellent
nephew
replied
uncle
rubbing
his
hands
with
the
gusto
philosopher
and
you
see
these
several
streaks
foam
that
the
tide
rises
least
ten
twelve
feet

indeed
marvelous

means
responded
the
contrary
quite
natural

may
appear
your
eyes
dear
uncle
was
reply
but
all
the
phenomena
the
place
appear
partake
the
marvelous
almost
impossible
believe
that
which
see
Who
his
wildest
dreams
could
have
imagined
that
beneath
the
crust
our
earth
there
could
exist
real
ocean
with
ebbing
and
flowing
tides
with
its
changes
winds
and
even
its
storms
for
one
should
have
laughed
the
suggestion
scorn

But
Harry
boy
why
not
inquired
uncle
with
pitying
smile
there
any
physical
reason
opposition
Well
give
the
great
theory
the
central
heat
the
earth
certainly
can
offer
reasons
why
anything
should
looked
upon
impossible

Then
you
will
own
added
that
the
system
Sir
Humphry
Davy
wholly
justified
what
have
seen

allow
that
is—and
that
point
once
granted
certainly
can
see
reason
for
doubting
the
existence
seas
and
other
wonders
even
countries
the
interior
the
globe

That
so—but
course
these
varied
countries
are
uninhabited

Well
grant
that
more
likely
than
not:
still
not
see
why
this
sea
should
not
have
given
shelter
some
species
unknown
fish

Hitherto
have
not
discovered
any
and
the
probabilities
are
rather
against
our
ever
doing
observed
the
Professor

was
losing
skepticism
the
presence
these
wonders

Well
determined
solve
the
question
intention
try
luck
with
fishing
line
and
hook

Certainly
make
the
experiment
said
uncle
pleased
with
enthusiasm
While
are
about
will
certainly
only
proper
discover
all
the
secrets
this
extraordinary
region

But
after
all
where
are
now
asked
all
this
time
have
quite
forgotten
ask
you
question
which
doubtless
your
philosophical
instruments
have
long
since
answered

Well
replied
the
Professor
examining
the
situation
from
only
one
point
view
are
now
distant
three
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
from
Iceland

much
was
exclamation

have
gone
over
the
matter
several
times
and
sure
not
have
made
mistake
five
hundred
yards
replied
uncle
positively

And
the
direction—are
still
going
the
southeast

Yes
with
western
declination[2]
nineteen
degrees
forty-two
minutes
just
above
for
the
inclination[3]
have
discovered
very
curious
fact

The
declination
the
variation
the
needle
from
the
true
meridian
place

Inclination
the
dip
the
magnetic
needle
with
tendency
incline
towards
the
earth

What
may
that
Uncle
Your
information
interests
Why
that
the
needle
instead
dipping
towards
the
pole
does
earth
the
northern
hemisphere
has
upward
tendency

This
proves
cried
that
the
great
point
magnetic
attraction
lies
somewhere
between
the
surface
the
earth
and
the
spot
have
succeeded
reaching

Exactly
observant
nephew
exclaimed
uncle
elated
and
delighted
and
quite
probable
that
succeed
getting
toward
the
polar
regions—somewhere
near
the
seventy-third
degree
latitude
where
Sir
James
Ross
discovered
the
magnetic
pole
shall
behold
the
needle
point
directly
upward
have
therefore
discovered
analogy
that
this
great
centre
attraction
not
situated
very
great
depth

Well
said
rather
surprised
this
discovery
will
astonish
experimental
philosophers
was
never
suspected

Science
great
mighty
and
the
end
unerring
replied
uncle
dogmatically
science
has
fallen
into
many
errors—errors
which
have
been
fortunate
and
useful
rather
than
otherwise
for
they
have
been
the
steppingstones
truth

After
some
further
discussion
turned
another
matter

Have
you
any
idea
the
depth
have
reached

are
now
continued
the
Professor
exactly
thirty-five
leagues—above
hundred
miles—down
into
the
interior
the
earth

said
after
measuring
the
distance
the
map
are
now
beneath
the
Scottish
Highlands
and
have
over
our
heads
the
lofty
Grampian
Hills

You
are
quite
right
said
the
Professor
laughing
sounds
very
alarming
the
weight
being
heavy—but
the
vault
which
supports
this
vast
mass
earth
and
rock
solid
and
safe
the
mighty
Architect
the
Universe
has
constructed
solid
materials
Man
even
his
highest
flights
vivid
and
poetic
imagination
never
thought
such
things
What
are
the
finest
arches
our
bridges
what
the
vaulted
roofs
our
cathedrals
that
mighty
dome
above
and
beneath
which
floats
ocean
with
its
storms
and
calms
and
tides

admire
all
much
you
can
Uncle
and
have
fear
that
our
granite
sky
will
fall
upon
our
heads
But
now
that
have
discussed
matters
science
and
discovery
what
are
your
future
intentions
Are
you
not
thinking
getting
back
the
surface
our
beautiful
earth

This
was
said
more
feeler
than
with
any
hope
success

back
nephew
cried
uncle
tone
alarm
you
are
not
surely
thinking
anything
absurd
cowardly
intention
advance
and
continue
our
journey
have
yet
been
singularly
fortunate
and
henceforth
hope
shall
more
But
said
how
are
cross
yonder
liquid
plain

not
intention
leap
into
head
foremost
even
swim
across
like
Leander
over
the
Hellespont
But
oceans
are
after
all
only
great
lakes
inasmuch
they
are
surrounded
land
does
stand
reason
that
this
central
sea
circumscribed
granite
surroundings

Doubtless
was
natural
reply

Well
then
you
not
think
that
when
once
reach
the
other
end
shall
find
some
means
continuing
our
journey

Probably
but
what
extent
you
allow
this
internal
ocean

Well
should
fancy
extend
about
forty
fifty
leagues—more
less

But
even
supposing
this
approximation
correct
one—what
then
asked

dear
boy
have
time
for
further
discussion
shall
embark
tomorrow

looked
around
with
surprise
and
incredulity

see
nothing

What
cried
are
about
launch
out
upon
unknown
sea
and
where
may
ask
the
vessel
carry
Well
dear
boy
will
not
exactly
what
you
would
call
vessel
For
the
present
must
content
with
good
and
solid
raft

raft
cried
incredulously
but
down
here

impossible
construction
vessel—and
loss
imagine—

good
Harry—if
you
were
listen
instead
talking
much
you
would
hear
said
uncle
waxing
little
impatient

should
hear

Yes—certain
knocks
with
the
hammer
which
Hans
now
employing
make
the
raft
has
been
work
for
many
hours

Making
raft

Yes

But
where
has
found
trees
suitable
for
such
construction

found
the
trees
all
ready
his
hand
Come
and
you
shall
see
our
excellent
guide
work

More
and
more
amazed
what
heard
and
saw
followed
uncle
like
one
dream

After
walk
about
quarter
hour
saw
Hans
work
the
other
side
the
promontory
which
formed
our
natural
port
few
minutes
more
and
was
beside
him
great
surprise
the
sandy
shore
lay
half-finished
raft
was
made
from
beams
very
peculiar
wood
and
great
number
limbs
joints
boughs
and
pieces
lay
about
sufficient
have
constructed
fleet
ships
and
boats

turned
uncle
silent
with
astonishment
and
awe

Where
did
all
this
wood
come
from
cried
what
wood
Well
there
pinewood
fir
and
the
palms
the
northern
regions
mineralized
the
action
the
sea
replied
sententiously

Can
possible

Yes
said
the
learned
Professor
what
you
see
called
fossil
wood

But
then
cried
after
reflecting
for
moment
like
the
lignites
must
hard
and
heavy
iron
and
therefore
will
certainly
not
float

Sometimes
that
the
case
Many
these
woods
have
become
true
anthracites
but
others
again
like
those
you
see
before
you
have
only
undergone
one
phase
fossil
transformation
But
there
proof
like
demonstration
added
uncle
picking
one
two
these
precious
waifs
and
casting
them
into
the
sea

The
piece
wood
after
having
disappeared
for
moment
came
the
surface
and
floated
about
with
the
oscillation
produced
wind
and
tide

Are
you
convinced
said
uncle
with
self-satisfied
smile

convinced
cried
that
what
see
incredible

The
fact
was
that
journey
into
the
interior
the
earth
was
rapidly
changing
all
preconceived
notions
and
day
day
preparing
for
the
marvelous

should
not
have
been
surprised
have
seen
fleet
native
canoes
afloat
upon
that
silent
sea

The
very
next
evening
thanks
the
industry
and
ability
Hans
the
raft
was
finished
was
about
ten
feet
long
and
five
feet
wide
The
beams
bound
together
with
stout
ropes
were
solid
and
firm
and
once
launched
our
united
efforts
the
improvised
vessel
floated
tranquilly
upon
the
waters
what
the
Professor
had
well
named
the
Central
Sea

six
o'clock
the
morning
when
the

Professor
gave
the
signal

all
our

had
collected

Hans
had
with
considerable
ingenuity
contrived

which
enabled
him
guide
the
floating
apparatus
with
ease
took

The
worthy

and
duck

then
let
the
painter
which
held
the
shore
the
sail
was
brought
the
wind
and
made
rapid
offing

Our
sea
voyage
had
length
commenced
and
once
more
were
making
for
distant
and
unknown
regions

Just
were
about
leave
the
little
port
where
the
raft
had
been
constructed
uncle
who
was
very
strong
geographic
nomenclature
wanted
give
name
and
among
others
suggested
mine

Well
said
before
you
decide
have
another
propose

Well
out
with
should
like
call
Gretchen
Port
Gretchen
will
sound
very
well
our
future
map

Well
then
Port
Gretchen
let
said
the
Professor

And
thus
was
that
the
memory
dear
girl
was
attached
our
adventurous
and
memorable
expedition

When
left
the
shore
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
northward
and
eastward
went
directly
before
the
wind
much
greater
speed
than
might
have
been
expected
from
raft
The
dense
layers
atmosphere
that
depth
had
great
propelling
power
and
acted
upon
the
sail
with
considerable
force

the
end
hour
uncle
who
had
been
taking
careful
observations
was
enabled
judge
the
rapidity
with
which
moved
was
far
beyond
anything
seen
the
upper
world

said
continue
advance
our
present
rate
shall
have
traveled
least
thirty
leagues
twenty-four
hours
With
mere
raft
this
almost
incredible
velocity

certainly
was
surprised
and
without
making
any
reply
went
forward
upon
the
raft
Already
the
northern
shore
was
fading
away
the
edge
the
horizon
The
two
shores
appeared
separate
more
and
more
leaving
wide
and
open
space
for
our
departure
Before
could
see
nothing
but
the
vast
and
apparently
limitless
sea—upon
which
floated—the
only
living
objects
sight

Huge
and
dark
clouds
cast
their
grey
shadows
below—shadows
which
seemed
crush
that
colorless
and
sullen
water
their
weight
Anything
more
suggestive
gloom
and
regions
nether
darkness
never
beheld
Silvery
rays
electric
light
reflected
here
and
there
upon
some
small
spots
water
brought
luminous
sparkles
the
long
wake
our
cumbrous
bark
Presently
were
wholly
out
sight
land
not
vestige
could
seen
nor
any
indication
where
were
going
still
and
motionless
did
seem
without
any
distant
point
fix
our
eyes
that
but
for
the
phosphoric
light
the
wake
the
raft
should
have
fancied
that
were
still
and
motionless

But
knew
that
were
advancing
very
rapid
rate

About
twelve
o'clock
the
day
vast
collections
seaweed
were
discovered
surrounding
all
sides
was
aware
the
extraordinary
vegetative
power
these
plants
which
have
been
known
creep
along
the
bottom
the
great
ocean
and
stop
the
advance
large
ships
But
never
were
seaweeds
ever
seen
gigantic
and
wonderful
those
the
Central
Sea
could
well
imagine
how
seen

tossing
and
heaving
the
summit

billows
the
long
lines

have
been
taken
for
living
things
and
thus
have
been

belief
sea
serpents

Our
raft
swept
past
great
specimens
fucus
seawrack
from
three
four
thousand
feet
length
immense
incredibly
long
looking
like
snakes
that
stretched
out
far
beyond
our
horizon
afforded
great
amusement
gaze
their
variegated
ribbon-like
endless
lengths
Hour
after
hour
passed
without
our
coming
the
termination
these
floating
weeds
astonishment
increased
patience
was
well-nigh
exhausted

What
natural
force
could
possibly
have
produced
such
abnormal
and
extraordinary
plants
What
must
have
been
the
aspect
the
globe
during
the
first
centuries
its
formation
when
under
the
combined
action
heat
and
humidity
the
vegetable
kingdom
occupied
its
vast
surface
the
exclusion
everything
else

These
were
considerations
never-ending
interest
for
the
geologist
and
the
philosopher

All
this
while
were
advancing
our
journey
and
length
night
came
but
had
remarked
the
evening
before
the
luminous
state
the
atmosphere
was
nothing
diminished
Whatever
was
the
cause
was
phenomenon
upon
the
duration
which
could
calculate
with
certainty

soon
our
supper
had
been
disposed
and
some
little
speculative
conversation
indulged
stretched
myself
the
foot
the
mast
and
presently
went
sleep

Hans
remained
motionless
the
tiller
allowing
the
raft
rise
and
fall
the
waves
The
wind
being
aft
and
the
sail
square
all
had
was
keep
his
oar
the
centre

Ever
since
had
taken
our

from
the
newly
named
Port
Gretchen

About
twelve
o'clock
the
day
our
guide
Hans
having
prepared
and
baited
hook
cast
his
line
into
the
subterranean
waters
The
bait
used
was
small
piece
meat
means
which
concealed
his
hook
Anxious
was
was
for
long
time
doomed
disappointment
Were
these
waters
supplied
with
fish
not
That
was
the
important
question
No—was
decided
answer
Then
there
came
sudden
and
rather
hard
tug
Hans
coolly
drew
and
with
fish
which
struggled
violently
escape

fish
cried
uncle

sturgeon
cried
certainly
small
sturgeon

The
Professor
examined
the
fish
carefully
noting
every
characteristic
and
did
not
coincide
opinion
The
fish
had
flat
head
round
body
and
the
lower
extremities
covered
with
bony
scales
its
mouth
was
wholly
without
teeth
the
pectoral
fins
which
were
highly
developed
sprouted
direct
from
the
body
which
properly
speaking
had
tail
The
animal
certainly
belonged
the
order
which
naturalists
class
the
sturgeon
but
differed
from
that
fish
many
essential
particulars

uncle
after
all
was
not
mistaken
After
long
and
patient
examination
said:

This
fish
dear
boy
belongs
family
which
has
been
extinct
for
ages
and
which
trace
has
ever
been
found
earth
except
fossil
remains
the
Devonian
strata

You
not
mean
say
cried
that
have
captured
live
specimen
fish
belonging
the
primitive
stock
that
existed
before
the
deluge

have
said
the
Professor
who
all
this
time
was
continuing
his
observations
and
you
may
see
careful
examination
that
these
fossil
fish
have
identity
with
existing
species
hold
one's
hand
therefore
living
specimen
the
order
enough
make
naturalist
happy
for
life

But
cried
what
family
does
belong

the
order
Ganoides—an
order
fish
having
angular
scales
covered
with
bright
enamel—forming
one
the
family
the
Cephalaspides
the
genus—

Well
sir
remarked
noticed
uncle
hesitated
conclude

the
genus
Pterychtis—yes
certain
Still
though
confident
the
correctness
surmise
this
fish
offers
our
notice
remarkable
peculiarity
never
known
exist
any
other
fish
but
those
which
are
the
natives
subterranean
waters
wells
lakes
caverns
and
suchlike
hidden
pools

And
what
may
that
blind

Blind
cried
much
surprised

Not
only
blind
continued
the
Professor
but
absolutely
without
organs
sight

now
examined
our
discovery
for
myself
was
singular
sure
but
was
really
fact
This
however
might
solitary
instance
suggested
The
hook
was
baited
again
and
once
more
thrown
into
the
water
This
subterranean
ocean
must
have
been
tolerably
well
supplied
with
fish
for
two
hours
took
large
number
Pterychtis
well
other
fish
belonging
another
supposed
extinct
family—the
Dipterides
genus
fish
furnished
with
two
fins
only
whence
the
name
though
uncle
could
not
class
exactly
All
without
exception
however
were
blind
This
unexpected
capture
enabled

our
stock
provisions
very
satisfactory
way

were
now
convinced
that
this
subterranean
sea
contained
only
fish
known
fossil
specimens—and
fish
and
reptiles
alike
were
all
the
more
perfect
the
farther
back
they
dated
their
origin

began
hope
that
should
find
some
those
saurians
which
science
has
succeeded
reconstructing
from
bits
bone
cartilage

took
the
telescope
and
carefully
examined
the
horizon—looked
over
the
whole
sea
was
utterly
and
entirely
deserted
Doubtless
were
still
too
near
the
coast

After
examination
the
ocean
looked
upward
towards
the
strange
and
mysterious
sky
Why
should
not
one
the
birds
reconstructed
the
immortal
Cuvier
flap
his
stupendous
wings
aloft
the
dull
strata
subterranean
air
would
course
find
quite
sufficient
food
from
the
fish
the
sea
gazed
for
some
time
upon
the
void
above
was
silent
and
deserted
the
shores
had
but
lately
left

Nevertheless
though
could
neither
see
nor
discover
anything
imagination
carried
away
into
wild
hypotheses
was
kind
waking
dream
thought
saw
the
surface
the
water
those
enormous
antediluvian
turtles
big
floating
islands
Upon
those
dull
and
somber
shores
passed
spectral

mammifers

with
the
Anoplotherium
singular
animal
partaking
the
nature
the
rhinoceros
the
horse
the
hippopotamus
and
the
camel

There
was
the
giant
Mastodon
twisting
and
turning
his
horrid
trunk
with
which
crushed
the
rocks
the
shore
powder
while
the
Megatherium—his
back
raised
like
cat
passion
his
enormous
claws
stretched
out
dug
into
the
earth
for
food
the
same
time
that
awoke
the
sonorous
echoes
the
whole
place
with
his
terrible
roar

Higher
still
the
first
monkey
ever
seen
the
face
the
globe
clambered
gamboling
and
playing
the
granite
hills
Still
farther
away
ran
the
Pterodactyl
with
the
winged
hand
gliding
rather
sailing
through
the
dense
and
compressed
air
like
huge
bat

Above
all
near
the
leaden
granitic
sky
were
immense
birds
more
powerful
than
the
cassowary
and
the
ostrich
which
spread
their
mighty
wings
and
fluttered
against
the
huge

such
was
the

The
mammifers
first
disappeared
then
the
mighty
birds
then
the
reptiles
the

presently
the
fish
the

the
mollusks
and
finally
the
vertebrata
The

the
period

their
turn
sank
into
annihilation

The
whole
panorama
the
world's
life
before
the
historic
period
seemed
born
over
again
and
mine
was
the
only
human
heart
that
beat
this
unpeopled
world
There
were
more
seasons
there
were
more
climates
the
natural
heat
the

increased
unceasingly
and
neutralized
that
the

which

were

Whole
ages

hundreds
years
were
concentrated
into

Next
unrolled
before
like
panorama
came
the
great
and
wondrous
series
terrestrial
transformations
Plants
disappeared
the
granitic
rocks
lost
all

the

was
suddenly
substituted
for

This

Where

What
the
matter
Harry
said
uncle
suddenly

eyes
which
were
wide
opened
like
those
somnambulist
were
fixed
upon
him
but
did
not
see
him
nor
could
clearly
make
out

around
Take
care
boy
again
cried
uncle
you
will
fall

uttered
these
words
felt
myself

our
devoted

Had

Hans
must
infallibly
have
fallen
into
the

and
been

Have
you
gone

cried
uncle
shaking
the

side

What—what
the
matter
said
last
coming
myself

Are
you
ill
Henry
continued
the
Professor
anxious
tone

No—no

have
had

All

uncle
uttered
these
words
rose
and
carefully
scanned
the

But
the

was
still
confounded
with
the

CHAPTER
TERRIFIC
SAURIAN

The

still

and
heavy
from
the

extraordinary
dream
which
cannot
yet
banish
from
mind

The
Professor
who
has
not
dreamed
however
one
his
morose
and
unaccountable
humors
Spends
his
time
scanning
the
horizon
every
point

compass
His
telescope

every
moment
his
eyes
and
when
finds

any

and

remarked
that
uncle
the
Professor
had
strong
tendency
resume
his
old
impatient
character
and
could
not
but
make
note
this
disagreeable
circumstance
journal
saw
clearly
that
had
required
all
the
influence
danger
and
suffering
extract
from
him
one
scintillation
humane
feeling
Now
that
was
quite
recovered
his
original
nature
had
conquered
and
obtained
the
upper
hand

And
after
all
what
had
angry
and
annoyed
about
now
more
than
any
other
time
Was
not
the
journey
being
accomplished
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
Was
not
the
raft
progressing
with
the
most
marvelous
rapidity

What
then
could
the
matter
After
one
two
preliminary
hems
determined
inquire

You
seem
uneasy
Uncle
said
when
for
about
the
hundredth
time
put
down
his
telescope
and
walked
and
down

What

cried

but
annoyed

the

much
vaster
than
expected

then
recollected
that
the
Professor
before
our
departure
had
estimated
the
length
this
subterranean
ocean
most
about
thirty
leagues
Now
had
traveled
least
over
thrice
that
distance
without
discovering
any
trace
the
distant
shore
began
understand
uncle's
anger

are
not
going
down
suddenly
exclaimed
the
Professor
are
not
progressing
with
our
great
discoveries
All
this
utter
loss
time
After
all
did
not

from
home
undertake

pleasure
This
voyage

over
pond
annoys
and

called
this
adventurous
journey
party

and
this
great
inland

But
argued

the

that

any

can
never
regret

come
thus

whole

nothing
about

nor
about

spectacles
came
down
into
the
interior
the
earth
with
object
and
that
object
mean
attain
Don't
talk
about
admiring
scenery
any
other
sentimental
trash

After
this
thought
well
hold
tongue
and
allow
the
Professor
bite
his
lips
until
the
blood
came
without
further
remark

six
o'clock
the
evening
our
matter-of-fact
guide
Hans
asked
for
his
week's
salary
and
receiving
his
three
rix-dollars
put
them
carefully
his
pocket
was
perfectly
contented
and
satisfied

Sunday
August
Nothing
new
record
The
same
weather
before
The
wind
has
slight
tendency
freshen
with
signs
approaching
gale
When
awoke
first
observation
was
regard
the
intensity
the
light
keep
fearing
day
after
day
that
the
extraordinary
electric
phenomenon
should
become
first
obscured
and
then
wholly
out
leaving
total
darkness
Nothing
however
the
kind
occurs
The
shadow
the
raft
its
mast
and
sails
clearly
distinguished
the
surface
the
water

This
wondrous
sea
after
all
infinite
its
extent
must
quite
wide
the
Mediterranean—or
perhaps
even
the
great
Atlantic
Ocean
Why
after
all
should
not
uncle
has
more
than
one
occasion
tried
deep-sea
soundings
tied
the
cross
one
our
heaviest
crowbars
the
extremity
cord
which
allowed
run
out
the
extent
two
hundred
fathoms
had
the
greatest
difficulty
hoisting
our
novel
kind
lead

When
the
crowbar
was
finally
dragged
board
Hans
called
attention
some
singular
marks
upon
its
surface
The
piece
iron
looked
had
been
crushed
between
two
very
hard
substances

looked
our
worthy
guide
with
inquiring
glance

Tander
said
course
was
loss
understand
turned
round
towards
uncle
absorbed
gloomy
reflections
had
little
wish
disturb
him
from
his
reverie
accordingly
turned
once
more
towards
our
worthy
Icelander

Hans
very
quietly
and
significantly
opened
his
mouth
once
twice
the
act
biting
and
this
way
made
understand
his
meaning

Teeth
cried
with
stupefaction
examined
the
bar
iron
with
more
attention

Yes
There
can
doubt
about
the
matter
The
indentations
the
bar
iron
are
the
marks
teeth
What
jaws
must
the
owner
such
molars
possessed
Have
then
come
upon
monster
unknown
species
which
still
exists
within
the
vast
waste
waters—a
monster
more
voracious
than
shark
more
terrible
and
bulky
than
the
whale
unable
withdraw
eyes
from
the
bar
iron
actually
half
crushed

then
dream
about
come
true—a
dread
and
terrible
reality

All
day
thoughts
were
bent
upon
these
speculations
and
imagination
scarcely
regained
degree
calmness
and
power
reflection
until
after
sleep
many
hours

This
day
other
Sundays
observed
day
rest
and
pious
meditation

Monday
August
have
been
trying
realize
from
memory
the
particular
instincts
those
antediluvian
animals
the
secondary
period
which
succeeding
the
mollusca
the
crustacea
and
the
fish
preceded
the
appearance
the
race
mammifers
The
generation
reptiles
then
reigned
supreme
upon
the
earth
These
hideous
monsters
ruled
everything
the
seas
the
secondary
period
which
formed
the
strata
which
the
Jura
mountains
are
composed
Nature
had
endowed
them
with
perfect
organization
What
gigantic
structure
was
theirs
what
vast
and
prodigious
strength
they
possessed

The
existing
saurians
which
include
all
such
reptiles
lizards
crocodiles
and
alligators
even
the
largest
and
most
formidable
their
class
are
but
feeble
imitations
their
mighty
sires
the
animals
ages
long
ago
there
were
giants
the
days
old
there
were
also
gigantic
animals

shuddered
evolved
from
mind
the
idea
and
recollection
these
awful
monsters
eye
man
had
seen
them
the
flesh
They
took
their
walks
abroad
upon
the
face
the
earth
thousands
ages
before
man
came
into
existence
and
their
fossil
bones
discovered
the
limestone
have
allowed
reconstruct
them
anatomically
and
thus
get
some
faint
idea
their
colossal
formation

recollect
once
seeing
the
great
Museum
Hamburg
the
skeleton
one
these
wonderful
saurians
measured
less
than
thirty
feet
from
the
nose
the
tail
then
inhabitant
the
earth
the
present
day
destined
find
myself
face
face
with
representative
this
antediluvian
family
can
scarcely
believe
possible
can
hardly
believe
true
And
yet
these
marks
powerful
teeth
upon
the
bar
iron
Can
there
doubt
from
their
shape
that
the
bite
the
bite
crocodile

eyes
stare
wildly
and
with
terror
upon
the
subterranean
sea
Every
moment
expect
one
these
monsters
rise
from
its
vast
cavernous
depths

fancy
that
the
worthy
Professor
some
measure
shares
notions
not
fears
for
after
attentive
examination
the
crowbar
cast
his
eyes
rapidly
over
the
mighty
and
mysterious
ocean

What
could
possess
him
leave
the
land
thought
the
depth
this
water
was
any
importance
doubt
has
disturbed
some
terrible
monster
his
watery
home
and
perhaps
may
pay
dearly
for
our
temerity

Anxious
prepared
for
the
worst
examined
our
weapons
and
saw
that
they
were
fit
state
for
use
uncle
looked
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
too
has
noticed
what
have
fear

Already
the
uplifting
the
waters
the
surface
indicates
that
something
motion
below
The
danger
approaches
comes
nearer
and
nearer
behooves
the
watch

Tuesday
August
Evening
came
last
the
hour
when
the
desire
for
sleep
caused
our
eyelids
heavy
Night
there

any
more

arctic
regions
Hans
however
immovable
the
rudder
When
snatches
moment
rest
really
cannot
say
take
advantage
his
vigilance
take
some
little
repose

But
two
hours
after
was
awakened
from
heavy
sleep
awful
shock
The
raft
appeared
have
struck
upon
sunken
rock
was
lifted
right
out
the
water
some
wondrous
and
mysterious
power
and
then

Hans
raised
his

and
pointed
where
about
two

yards
off

Look

the
Professor

See

how
she

Two
liquid
columns
rose
vast
height
above
the
level
the
sea
into
which
they
fell
with
terrific
crash
waking
the
echoes
that
awful
place
stood
still—surprised
stupefied
terror-stricken
the
sight
this
group
fearful
marine
monsters
more
hideous
the
reality
than
dream
They
were
supernatural
dimensions
the
very
smallest
the
whole
party
could
with
ease
have
crushed
our
raft
and
ourselves
with
single
bite

Hans
seizing
the
rudder
which
had
flown
out
his
hand
puts
hard
aweather

escape
from
such
dangerous
vicinity
but
sooner

Look
which

The
fearful
reptiles
advanced
upon
they
turned
and
twisted
about
the
raft
with
awful
rapidity
They
formed
around
our
devoted
vessel

concentric
circles
took

But
what
effect
can
rifle
ball
produce
upon
the
armor
scales
with
which
the
bodies
these
horrid
monsters
are
covered

remain
still
and
dumb
from
utter
horror
They
advance
upon
nearer
and
nearer
Our
fate
appears
certain
fearful
and
terrible
one
side
the
mighty
crocodile
the
other
the

The

and

Hans
the
guide
however
interfered
sign
check
The
two
hideous
and
ravenous
monsters
passed
within
fifty
fathoms
the
raft
and
then
made
rush
one
another—their
fury
and
rage
preventing
them
from
seeing
The
combat
commenced
distinctly
made
out
every
action
the
two
hideous
monsters

But
excited
imagination
the
other
animals
appeared
about
take
part
the
fierce
and
deadly
struggle—the
monster
the
whale
the
lizard
and
the
turtle
distinctly
saw
them
every
moment
pointed
them
out
the
Icelander
But
only
shook
his
head

What—two

Surely

quite
right
replied
uncle
coolly
and
philosophically
examining
the
terrible
duel

How
can
that
Yes
The

And
the
other

The
other
monstrous
serpent
concealed
under
the
hard
vaulted
shell
the
turtle
the
terrible
enemy
its
fearful
rival
the
Plesiosaurus
sea
crocodile

Hans
was
quite
right
The
two
monsters
only
disturbed
the
surface
the
sea

last
have
mortal
eyes
gazed
upon
two
reptiles
the
great
primitive
ocean
see
the
flaming
red
eyes
the
Ichthyosaurus
each
big
bigger
than
man's
head
Nature
its
infinite
wisdom
had
gifted
this
wondrous
marine
animal
with
optical
apparatus
extreme
power
capable
resisting
the
pressure
the
heavy
layers
water
which
rolled
over
him
the
depths
the
ocean
where
usually
fed
has
some
authors
truly
been
called
the
whale
the
saurian
race
for
big
and
quick
its
motions
our
king
the
seas
This
one
measures
not
less
than
hundred
feet
length
and
can
form
some
idea
his
girth
when
see
him
lift
his
prodigious
tail
out
the
waters
His
jaw
awful
size
and
strength
and
according
the
best-informed
naturalists
does
not
contain
less
than
hundred
and
eighty-two
teeth

The
other
was
the
mighty
Plesiosaurus
serpent
with
cylindrical
trunk
with
short
stumpy
tail
with
fins
like
bank
oars
Roman
galley

Its
whole
body
covered
carapace
shell
and
its
neck
flexible
that
swan
rose
more
than
thirty
feet
above
the
waves
tower
animated
flesh

These
animals
attacked
one
another
with
inconceivable
fury
Such
combat
was
never
seen
before
mortal
eyes
and
who
did
see
appeared
more
like
the
phantasmagoric
creation
dream
than
anything
else
They
raised
mountains
water
which
dashed
spray
over
the
raft
already
tossed
and
fro
the
waves
Twenty
times
seemed
the
point
being
upset
and
hurled
headlong
into
the
waves
Hideous
hisses
appeared
shake
the
gloomy
granite
roof
that
mighty
cavern—hisses
which
carried
terror
our
hearts
The
awful
combatants
held
each
other
tight
embrace
could
not
make
out
one
from
the
other
Still
the
combat
could
not
last
forever
and
woe
unto
whichsoever
became
the
victor

One
hour
two
hours
three
hours
passed
away
without
any
decisive
result
The
struggle
continued
with
the
same
deadly
tenacity
but
without
apparent
result
The
deadly
opponents
now
approached
now
drew
away
from
the
raft
Once
twice
fancied
they
were
about
leave
altogether
but
instead
that
they
came
nearer

the

Still

Suddenly
the
Ichthyosaurus
and
the
Plesiosaurus
disappeared
beneath

waves

behind

maelstrom

the
sea

nearly
drawn
down

Several
minutes
elapsed
before

Was

combat

ocean
Was
the
last
act
this
terrible

without
spectators

was
impossible
for
say

Suddenly
great
distance
from
enormous
mass
rises
out
the
waters—the
head
the
great
Plesiosaurus
The
terrible
monster
now
wounded
unto
death
can
see
nothing
now
his
enormous
body
All
that
could
distinguished
was
his
serpent-like
neck
which
twisted
and
curled
all
the
agonies
death
Now
struck
the
waters
with

then
again
wriggled
like

The
water
was
spurted

over

nearly
blinded
But
soon
the
end
the
beast
approached
nearer
and
nearer
his
movements
slackened
visibly
his
contortions
almost
ceased
and
last
the
body
the
mighty
snake
lay
inert
dead

the
surface
the
now
calm
and
placid
waters

for
the
Ichthyosaurus

This
question
remained
unanswered
And
had
breathing
time

CHAPTER
THE
SEA
MONSTER

Wednesday
August
Fortunately
the
wind
which
for
the
present
blows
with
some
violence
has
allowed
escape
from
the
scene
the
unparalleled
and
extraordinary
struggle
Hans
with
his
usual
imperturbable
calm
remained
the
helm
uncle
who
for
short
time
had
been
withdrawn
from
his
absorbing
reveries
the
novel
incidents
this
sea
fight
fell
back
again
apparently
into
brown
study
His
eyes
were
fixed
impatiently
the
widespread
ocean

Our
voyage
now
became
monotonous
and
uniform
Dull
has
become
have
desire
have
broken
any
repetition
the
perils
and
adventures
yesterday

Thursday
August
The
wind
now
and
blows
very
irregularly
has
changed
fitful
gusts
The
temperature
exceedingly
high
are
now
progressing
the
average
rate
about
ten
miles
and
half
per
hour

About
twelve
o'clock
distant
sound
thunder
fell
upon
our
ears
make
note
the
fact
without
even
venturing
suggestion
its
cause
was
one
continued
roar
sea
falling
over
mighty
rocks

Far
off
the
distance
said
the
Professor
dogmatically
there
some
rock
some
island
against
which
the
sea
lashed
fury
the
wind
breaking
violently

Hans
without
saying
word
clambered
the
top
the
mast
but
could
make
out
nothing
The
ocean
was
level
every
direction
far
the
eye
could
reach

Three
hours
passed
away
without
any
sign
indicate
what
might
before
The
sound
began
assume
that
mighty
cataract

expressed
opinion
this
point
strongly
uncle
merely
shook
his
head
however
strongly
impressed
conviction
that
not
wrong
Are
advancing
towards
some
mighty
waterfall
which
shall
cast
into
the
abyss
Probably
this
mode
descending
into
the
abyss
may
agreeable
the
Professor
because
would
something
like
the
vertical
descent
eager
make
entertain
very
different
opinion

Whatever
the
truth
certain
that
not
many
leagues
distant
there
must
some
very
extraordinary
phenomenon
for
advance
the
roar
becomes
something
mighty
and
stupendous
the
water
the
air

cast
hasty
glances
aloft
the
suspended
vapors
and
seek
penetrate
their
mighty
depths
But
the
vault
above
tranquil
The
clouds
which
are
now
elevated
the
very
summit
appear
utterly
still
and
motionless
and
completely
lost
the
irradiation
electric
light
necessary
therefore
seek
for
the
cause
this
phenomenon
elsewhere

examine
the
horizon
now
perfectly
calm
pure
and
free
from
all
haze
Its
aspect
still
remains
unchanged
But
this
awful
noise
proceeds
from
cataract—if
speak
plain
English
this
vast
interior
ocean
precipitated
into
lower
basin—if
these
tremendous
roars
are
produced
the
noise
falling
waters
the
current
would
increase
activity
and
its
increasing
swiftness
would
give
some
idea
the
extent
the
peril
with
which
are
menaced
consult
the
current
simply
does
not
exist:
there
such
thing
empty
bottle
cast
into
the
water
lies
leeward
without
motion

About
four
o'clock
Hans
rises
clambers
the
mast
and
reaches
the
truck
itself
From
this
elevated
position
his
looks
are
cast
around
They
take
vast
circumference
the
ocean
last
his
eyes
remain
fixed
His
face
expresses
astonishment
but
his
eyes
slightly
dilate

has
seen
something
last
cried
uncle

think
replied

Hans
came
down
stood
beside
and
pointed
with
his
right
hand
the
south

Der
nere
said

There
replied
uncle

And
seizing
his
telescope
looked
with
great
attention
for
about
minute
which
appeared
age
knew
not
what
think
expect

Yes
yes
cried
tone
considerable
surprise
there
What
asked

tremendous
spurt
water
rising
out
the
waves

Some
other
marine
monster
cried
already
alarmed

Perhaps

Then
let
steer
more
the
westward
for
know
what
have
expect
from
antediluvian
animals
was
eager
reply

ahead
said
uncle

turned
towards
Hans
Hans
was
the
tiller
steering
with
his
usual
imperturbable
calm

Nevertheless
from
the
distance
which
separated
from
this
creature
distance
which
must
estimated
not
less
than
dozen
leagues
one
could
see
the
column
water
spurting
from
the
blow-hole
the
great
animal
his
dimensions
must
something
preternatural
fly
therefore
the
course
suggested
ordinary
prudence
But
have
not
come
into
that
part
the
world
prudent
Such
uncle's
determination

accordingly
continued
advance
The
nearer
come
the
loftier
the
spouting
water
What
monster
can
fill
himself
with
such
huge
volumes
water
and
then
unceasingly
spout
them
out
such
lofty
jets

eight
o'clock
the
evening
reckoning
above
ground
where
there
day
and
night
are
not
more
than
two
leagues
from
the
mighty
beast
Its
long
black
enormous
mountainous
body
lies
the
top
the
water
like
island
But
then
sailors
have
been
said
have
gone
ashore
sleeping
whales
mistaking
them
for
land
illusion
fear
Its
length
cannot
less
than
thousand
fathoms
What
then
this
cetaceous
monster
which
Cuvier
ever
thought

quite
motionless
and
presents
the
appearance
sleep
The
sea
seems
unable
lift
him
upwards
rather
the
waves
which
break
his
huge
and
gigantic
frame
The
waterspout
rising
height
five
hundred
feet
breaks
spray
with
dull
sullen
roar

advance
like
senseless
lunatics
towards
this
mighty
mass

honestly
confess
that
was
abjectly
afraid
declared
that
would
farther
threatened
terror
cut
the
sheet
the
sail
attacked
the
Professor
with
considerable
acrimony
calling
him
foolhardy
mad
know
not
what
made
answer

Suddenly
the
imperturbable
Hans
once
more
pointed
his
finger
the
menacing
object:

Holme

island
cried
uncle

island
replied
shrugging
shoulders
this
poor
attempt
deception

course
cried
uncle
bursting
into
loud
and
joyous
laugh

But
the
waterspout

Geyser
said
Hans

Yes
course—a
geyser
replied
uncle
still
laughing
geyser
like
those
common
Iceland
Jets
like
this
are
the
great
wonders
the
country

first
would
not
allow
that
had
been
grossly
deceived
What
could
more
ridiculous
than
have
taken
island
for
marine
monster
But
kick
one
may
one
must
yield
evidence
and
was
finally
convinced
error
was
nothing
after
all
but
natural
phenomenon

approached
nearer
and
nearer
the
dimensions
the
liquid
sheaf
waters
became
truly
grand
and
stupendous
The
island
had
distance
presented
the
appearance
enormous
whale
whose
head
rose
high
above
the
waters
The
geyser
word
the
Icelanders
pronounce
geysir
and
which
signifies
fury
rose
majestically
from
its
summit
Dull
detonations
are
heard
every
now
and
then
and
the
enormous
jet
taken
were
with
sudden
fury
shakes
its
plume
vapor
and
bounds
into
the
first
layer
the
clouds
alone
Neither
spurts
vapor
nor
hot
springs
surround
and
the
whole
volcanic
power
that
region
concentrated
one
sublime
column
The
rays
electric
light
mix
with
this
dazzling
sheaf
every
drop
falls
assuming
the
prismatic
colors
the
rainbow

Let
shore
said
the
Professor
after
some
minutes
silence

necessary
however
take
great
precaution
order
avoid
the
weight
falling
waters
which
would
cause
the
raft
founder
instant
Hans
however
steers
admirably
and
brings
the
other
extremity
the
island

was
the
first
leap
the
rock
uncle
followed
while
the
eider-duck
hunter
remained
still
like
man
above
any
childish
sources
astonishment
were
now
walking
granite
mixed
with
siliceous
sandstone
the
soil
shivered
under
our
feet
like
the
sides
boilers
which
over-heated
steam
forcibly
confined
burning
soon
came
sight
the
little
central
basin
from
which
rose
the
geyser
plunged
thermometer
into
the
water
which
ran
bubbling
from
the
centre
and
marked
heat
hundred
and
sixty-three
degrees

This
water
therefore
came
from
some
place
where
the
heat
was
intense
This
was
singularly
contradiction
with
the
theories
Professor
Hardwigg
could
not
help
telling
him
opinion
the
subject

Well
said
sharply
and
what
does
this
prove
against
doctrine

Nothing
replied
dryly
seeing
that
was
running
head
against
foregone
conclusion

Nevertheless
compelled
confess
that
until
now
have
been
most
remarkably
fortunate
and
that
this
voyage
being
accomplished
most
favorable
conditions
temperature
but
appears
evident
fact
certain
that
shall
sooner
later
arrive
one
those
regions
where
the
central
heat
will
reach
its
utmost
limits
and
will
far
beyond
all
the
possible
gradations
thermometers

Visions
the
Hades
the
ancients
believed
the
centre
the
earth
floated
through
imagination

shall
however
see
what
shall
see
That
the
Professor's
favorite
phrase
now
Having
christened
the
volcanic
island
the
name
his
nephew
the
leader
the
expedition
turned
away
and
gave
the
signal
for
embarkation

stood
still
however
for
some
minutes
gazing
upon
the
magnificent
geyser
soon
was
able
perceive
that
the
upward
tendency
the
water
was
irregular
now
diminished
intensity
and
then
suddenly
regained
new
vigor
which
attributed
the
variation
the
pressure
the
accumulated
vapors
its
reservoir

last
took
our
departure
going
carefully
round
the
projecting
and
rather
dangerous
rocks
the
southern
side
Hans
had
taken
advantage
this
brief
halt
repair
the
raft

Before
took
our
final
departure
from
the
island
however
made
some
observations
calculate
the
distance
had
gone
over
and
put
them
down
journal
Since
left
Port
Gretchen
had
traveled
two
hundred
and
seventy
leagues—more
than
eight
hundred
miles—on
this
great
inland
sea
were
therefore
six
hundred
and
twenty
leagues
from
Iceland
and
exactly
under
England

CHAPTER
THE
BATTLE
THE
ELEMENTS

Friday
August
This
morning
the
magnificent
geyser
had
wholly
disappeared
The
wind
had
freshened
and
were
fast
leaving
the
neighborhood
Henry's
Island
Even
the
roaring
sound
the
mighty
column
was
lost
the
ear

The
weather
under
the
circumstances
may
use
such
expression
about
change
very
suddenly
The
atmosphere
being
gradually
loaded
with
vapors
which
carry
with
them
the
electricity
formed
the
constant
evaporation
the
saline
waters
the
clouds
are
slowly
but
sensibly
falling
towards
the
sea
and
are
assuming
dark-olive
texture
the
electric
rays
can
scarcely
pierce
through
the
opaque
curtain
which
has
fallen
like
drop
scene
before
this
wondrous
theater
the
stage
which
another
and
terrible
drama
soon
enacted
This
time
fight
animals
the
fearful
battle
the
elements

feel
that
very
peculiarly
influenced
all
creatures
are
land
when
deluge
about
take
place

The
cumuli
perfectly
oval
kind
cloud
piled
upon
the
south
presented
most
awful
and
sinister
appearance
with
the
pitiless
aspect
often
seen
before
storm
The
air
extremely
heavy
the
sea
comparatively
calm

the
distance
the
clouds
have
assumed
the
appearance
enormous
balls
cotton
rather
pods
piled
one
above
the
other
picturesque
confusion
degrees
they
appear
swell
out
break
and
gain
number
what
they
lose
grandeur
their
heaviness
great
that
they
are
unable
lift
themselves
from
the
horizon
but
under
the
influence

and
then
present
the
appearance
one

formidable

now
and
then
lighter
cloud
still
lit
from
above
rebounds
upon
this
grey
carpet
and
lost
the
opaque
mass

There
can
doubt
that
the
entire

with

under

ventured

think
would
receive
rather
violent
and
unpleasant
shock

About
ten
o'clock
the
morning
the
symptoms
the
storm
became
more
thorough
and
decisive
the
wind
appeared
soften
down
take
breath
for
renewed
attack
the
vast
funereal
pall
above
looked
like
huge
bag—like
the
cave
AEolus
which
the
storm
was
collecting
its
forces
for
the
attack

tried
all
could
not
believe
the
menacing
signs
the
sky
and
yet
could
not
avoid
saying
were
involuntarily:

believe

going
have
bad
weather

The
Professor
made
answer
was
horrible
detestable
humor—to
see
the
ocean
stretching
interminably
before
his
eyes
hearing
words
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders

shall
have
tremendous
storm
said
again
pointing
the
horizon
These
clouds
are
falling
lower
and
lower
upon
the
sea
crush
great
silence
prevailed
The
wind
wholly
ceased
Nature
assumed
dead
calm
and
ceased
breathe
Upon
the
mast
where
noticed
sort
slight
ignis
fatuus
the
sail
hangs
loose
heavy
folds
The
raft
motionless
the
midst
dark
heavy
sea—without
undulation
without
motion
still
glass
But
are
making
progress
what
the
use
keeping
the
sail
which
may
the
cause
our
perdition
the
tempest
should
suddenly
strike
without
warning

Let
lower
the
sail
said
only
act
common
prudence

No—no
cried
uncle
exasperated
tone
hundred
times
Let
the
wind
strike
and
its
worst
let
the
storm
sweep
away
where
will—only
let
see
the
glimmer
some
coast—of
some
rocky
cliffs
even
they
dash
our
raft
into
thousand
pieces
keep
the
sail—no
matter
what
happens

These
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
the
southern
horizon
underwent
sudden
and
violent
change
The
long
accumulated
vapors
were
resolved
into
water
and
the
air
required

the
void
produced
became
wild
and
raging
tempest

came
from
the
most
distant
corners
the
mighty
cavern
raged
from
every
point
the
compass
roared
yelled
shrieked
with
glee
demons
let
loose
The
darkness
increased
and
became
indeed
darkness
visible

The
raft
rose
and
fell
with
the
storm
and
bounded
over
the
waves
uncle
was
cast
headlong
upon
the
deck
with
great
difficulty
dragged
myself
towards
him
was
holding
with
might
and
main
the
end
cable
and
appeared
gaze
with
pleasure
and
delight
the
spectacle
the
unchained
elements

Hans
never
moved
muscle
His
long
hair
driven
hither
and
thither
the
tempest
and
scattered
wildly
over
his
motionless
face
gave
him
most
extraordinary
appearance—for
every
single
hair
was
illuminated
little
sparkling
sprigs

His
countenance
presents
the
extraordinary
appearance
antediluvian
man
true
contemporary
the
Megatherium

Still
the
mast
holds
good
against
the
storm
The
sail
spreads
out
and
fills
like
soap
bubble
about
burst
The
raft
rushes
pace
impossible
estimate
but
still
less
swiftly
than
the
body
water
displaced
beneath
the
rapidity
which
may
seen
the
lines
which
fly
right
and
left
the
wake

The
sail
the
sail
cried
making
trumpet
hands
and
then
endeavoring
lower
Let
alone
said
uncle
more
exasperated
than
ever

Nej
said
Hans
gently
shaking
his
head

Nevertheless
the
rain
formed
roaring
cataract
before
this
horizon
which
were
search
and
which
were
rushing
like
madmen

But
before
this
wilderness
waters
reached
the
mighty
veil
cloud
was
torn
twain
the
sea
began
foam
wildly
and
the
electricity
produced
some
vast
and
extraordinary
chemical
action
the
upper
layer
cloud
brought
into
play
the
fearful
claps
thunder
are
added
dazzling
flashes
lightning
such
had
never
seen
The
flashes
crossed
one
another
hurled
from
every
side
while
the
thunder
came
pealing
like
echo
The
mass
vapor
becomes
incandescent
the
hailstones
which
strike
the
metal
our
boots
and
our
weapons
are
actually
luminous
the
waves
they
rise
appear
fire-eating
monsters
beneath
which
seethes
intense
fire
their

eyes
are
dazzled
blinded
the

ears
are
deafened
the
awful
roar
the
elements
compelled
hold
onto
the
mast
which
bends
like
reed
beneath
the
violence
the
storm
which
none
ever
before
seen
mariners
bore
any
resemblance

Here
traveling
notes
become
very
incomplete
loose
and
vague
have
only
been
able
make
out
one
two
fugitive
observations
jotted
down

But
even
their
brevity
even
their
obscurity
show
the
emotions
which
overcame
Sunday

Where

The

The

Our

The

The

With

and
acquiesced

His

CHAPTER
OUR
ROUTE
REVERSED

Here
ends
what
call
Journal
our
voyage
board
the
raft
which
journal
was
happily
saved
from
the
wreck
proceed
with
narrative
did
before
commenced
daily
notes

What
happened
when
the
terrible
shock
took
place
when
the
raft
was
cast
upon
the
rocky
shore
would
impossible
for
now
say
felt
myself
precipitated
violently
into
the
boiling
waves
and
escaped
from
certain
and
cruel
death
was
wholly
owing
the
determination
the
faithful
Hans
who
clutching
the
arm
saved
from
the
yawning
abyss

The
courageous
Icelander
then
carried
his
powerful
arms
far
out
the
reach
the
waves
and
laid
down
upon
burning
expanse
sand
where
found
myself
some
time
afterwards
the
company
uncle
the
Professor

Then
quietly
returned
towards
the
fatal
rocks
against
which
the
furious
waves
were
beating
order
save
any
stray
waifs
from
the
wreck
This
man
was
always
practical
and
thoughtful
could
not
utter
word
was
quite
overcome
with
emotion
whole
body
was
broken
and
bruised
with
fatigue
took
hours
before
was
anything
like
myself

Meanwhile
there
fell
fearful
deluge
rain
drenching
the
skin
Its
very
violence
however
proclaimed
the
approaching
end
the
storm
Some
overhanging
rocks
afforded
slight
protection
from
the
torrents

Under
this
shelter
Hans
prepared
some
food
which
however
was
unable
touch
and
exhausted
the
three
weary
days
and
nights
watching
fell
into
deep
and
painful
sleep
dreams
were
fearful
but
last
exhausted
nature
asserted
her
supremacy
and
slumbered

Next
day
when
awoke
the
change
was
magical
The
weather
was
magnificent
Air
and
sea
mutual
consent
had
regained
their
serenity
Every
trace
the
storm
even
the
faintest
had
disappeared
was
saluted
awakening
the
first
joyous
tones
had
heard
from
the
Professor
for
many
day
His
gaiety
indeed
was
something
terrible

Well
lad
cried
rubbing
his
hands
together
have
you
slept
soundly

Might
not
have
been
supposed
that
were
the
old
house
the
Konigstrasse
that
had
just
come
down
quietly
breakfast
and
that
marriage
with
Gretchen
was
take
place
that
very
day
uncle's
coolness
was
exasperating

Alas
considering
how
the
tempest
had
driven
easterly
direction
had
passed
under
the
whole
Germany
under
the
city
Hamburg
where
had
been
happy
under
the
very
street
which
contained
all
loved
and
cared
for
the
world

was
positive
fact
that
was
only
separated
from
her
distance
forty
leagues
But
these
forty
leagues
were
hard
impenetrable
granite

All
these
dreary
and
miserable
reflections
passed
through
mind
before
attempted
answer
uncle's
question

Why
what
the
matter
cried
Cannot
you
say
whether
you
have
slept
well
not

have
slept
very
well
was
reply
but
every
bone
body
aches
suppose
that
will
lead
nothing

Nothing
all
boy
only
the
result
the
fatigue
the
last
few
days—that
all

You
appear—if
may
allowed
say
so—to
very
jolly
this
morning
said

Delighted
dear
boy
delighted
Was
never
happier
life
have
last
reached
the
wished-for
port

The
end
our
expedition
cried
tone
considerable
surprise

but
the
confines
that
sea
which
began
fear
would
never
end
but
round
the
whole
world
will
now
tranquilly
resume
our
journey
land
and
once
again
endeavor
dive
into
the
centre
the
earth

dear
uncle
began
hesitating
kind
way
allow
ask
you
one
question

Certainly
Harry
dozen
you
think
proper

One
will
suffice
How
about
getting
back
asked

How
about
getting
back
What
question
ask
have
not
yet
reached
the
end
our
journey

know
that
All
want
know
how
you
propose
shall
manage
the
return
voyage

the
most
simple
manner
the
world
said
the
imperturbable
Professor
Once
reach
the
exact
centre
this
sphere
either
shall
find
new
road
which
ascend
the
surface
shall
simply
turn
round
and
back
the
way
came
have
every
reason
believe
that
while
are
traveling
forward
will
not
close
behind
Then
one
the
first
matters
see
will
repair
the
raft
was
rather
melancholy
response

course
must
attend
that
above
all
things
continued
the
Professor

Then
comes
the
all-important
question
provisions
urged
Have
anything
like
enough
left
enable
accomplish
such
great
such
amazing
designs
you
contemplate
carrying
out

have
seen
into
the
matter
and
answer
the
affirmative
Hans
very
clever
fellow
and
have
reason
believe
that
has
saved
the
greater
part
the
cargo
But
the
best
way
satisfy
your
scruples
come
and
judge
for
yourself

Saying
which
led
the
way
out
the
kind
open
grotto
which
had
taken
shelter
had
almost
begun
hope
that
which
should
rather
have
feared
and
this
was
the
impossibility
such
shipwreck
leaving
even
the
slightest
signs
what
had
carried
freight
was
however
thoroughly
mistaken

soon
reached
the
shores
this
inland
sea
found
Hans
standing
gravely
the
midst
large
number
things
laid
out
complete
order
uncle
wrung
his
hands
with
deep
and
silent
gratitude
His
heart
was
too
full
for
speech

This
man
whose
superhuman
devotion
his
employers
not
only
never
saw
surpassed
nor
even
equaled
had
been
hard
work
all
the
time
slept
and
the
risk
his
life
had
succeeded
saving
the
most
precious
articles
our
cargo

course
under
the
circumstances
necessarily
experienced
several
severe
losses
Our
weapons
had
wholly
vanished
But
experience
had
taught
without
them
The
provision
powder
had
however
remained
intact
after
having
narrowly
escaped
blowing
all
atoms
the
storm

Well
said
the
Professor
who
was
now
ready
make
the
best
everything
have
guns
all
have
give
all
idea
hunting

Yes
dear
sir
can
without
them
but
what
about
all
our
instruments

Here
the
manometer
the
most
useful
all
and
which
gladly
accept
lieu
the
rest
With
alone
can
calculate
the
depth
proceed
its
means
alone
shall
able
decide
when
have
reached
the
centre
the
earth
but
for
this
little
instrument
might
make
mistake
and
run
the
risk
coming
out
the
antipodes

All
this
was
said
amid
bursts
unnatural
laughter

But
the
compass
cried
without
that
what
can
Here
safe
and
sound
cried
with
real
joy
and
here
have
the
chronometer
and
the
thermometers
Hans
the
hunter
indeed
invaluable
man

was
impossible
deny
this
fact
far
the
nautical
and
other
instruments
were
concerned
nothing
was
wanting
Then
further
examination
found
ladders
cords
pickaxes
crowbars
and
shovels
all
scattered
about
the
shore

There
was
however
finally
the
most
important
question
all
and
that
was
provisions

But
what
are
for
food
asked

Let
see
the
commissariat
department
replied
uncle
gravely

The
boxes
which
contained
our
supply
food
for
the
voyage
were
placed
row
along
the
strand
and
were
capital
state
preservation
the
sea
had
every
case
respected
their
contents
and
sum
one
sentence
taking
into
consideration
biscuits
salt
meat
Schiedam
and
dried
fish
could
still
calculate
having
about
four
months'
supply
used
with
prudence
and
caution

Four
months
cried
the
sanguine
Professor
high
glee
Then
shall
have
plenty
time
both
and
come
and
with
what
remains
undertake
give
grand
dinner
colleagues
the
Johanneum

sighed
should
this
time
have
become
used
the
temperament
uncle
and
yet
this
man
astonished
more
and
more
every
day
was
the
greatest
human
enigma
ever
had
known

Now
before
anything
else

The

There

which
our

Hans

though
have
every

How
that
cried
more
amazed
than
ever
uncle's
style
reasoning

have
idea
dear
boy
none
other
than
this
simple
fact
shall
not
come
out
the
same
opening
that
which
entered

began
look
uncle
with
vague
suspicion
idea
had
more
than
once
taken
possession
and
this
was
that
was
going
mad
And
yet
little
did
think
how
true
and
prophetic
his
words
were
doomed
And
now
said
having
seen
all
these
matters
detail
breakfast

followed
him
sort
projecting
cape
after
had
given
his
last
instructions
our
guide
this
original
position
with
dried
meat
biscuit
and
delicious
cup
tea
made
satisfactory
meal—I
may
say
one
the
most
welcome
and
pleasant
ever
remember
Exhaustion
the
keen
atmosphere
the
state
calm
after
much
agitation
all
contributed
give
excellent
appetite
Indeed
contributed
very
much
producing
pleasant
and
cheerful
state
mind

While
breakfast
was
hand
and
between
the
sips
warm
tea
asked
uncle
had
any
idea
how
now
stood
relation
the
world
above

For
part
added
think
will
rather
difficult
determine

Well
were
compelled
fix
the
exact
spot
said
uncle
might
difficult
since
during
the
three
days
that
awful
tempest
could
keep
account
either
the
quickness
our
pace
the
direction
which
the
raft
was
going
Still
will
endeavor
approximate
the
truth
shall
not
believe
very
far
out

Well
recollect
rightly
replied
our
last
observation
was
made
the
geyser
island

Harry's
Island
boy
Harry's
Island
not
decline
the
honor
having
named
given
your
name
island
discovered
the
first
human
beings
who
trod
since
the
creation
the
world

Let
then
Harry's
Island
had
already
gone
over
two
hundred
and
seventy
leagues
sea
and
were
believe
about
six
hundred
leagues
more
less
from
Iceland

Good
glad
see
that
you
remember
well
Let
start
from
that
point
and
let
count
four
days
storm
during
which
our
rate
traveling
must
have
been
very
great
should
say
that
our
velocity
must
have
been
about
eighty
leagues
the
twenty-four
hours

agreed
that
thought
this
fair
calculation
There
were
then
three
hundred
leagues
added
the
grand
total

Yes
and
the
Central
Sea
must
extend
least
six
hundred
leagues
from
side
side
you
know
boy
Harry
that
have
discovered
inland
lake
larger
than
the
Mediterranean

Certainly
and
only
know
its
extent
one
way
may
hundreds
miles
length

Very
likely

Then
said
after
calculating
for
some
for
some
minutes
your
previsions
are
right
are
this
moment
exactly
under
the
Mediterranean
itself

you
think
Yes
almost
certain
Are
not
nine
hundred
leagues
distant
from
Reykjavik

That
perfectly
true
and
famous
bit
road
have
traveled
boy
But
why
should
under
the
Mediterranean
more
than
under
Turkey
the
Atlantic
Ocean
can
only
known
when
are
sure
not
having
deviated
from
our
course
and
this
know
nothing

not
think
were
driven
very
far
from
our
course
the
wind
appears
have
been
always
about
the
same
opinion
that
this
shore
must
situated
the
southeast
Port
Gretchen

Good—I
hope
will
however
easy
decide
the
matter
taking
the
bearings
from
our
departure
means
the
compass
Come
along
and
will
consult
that
invaluable
invention

The
Professor
now
walked
eagerly
the
direction
the
rock
where
the
indefatigable
Hans
had
placed
the
instruments
safety
uncle
was
gay
and
lighthearted
rubbed
his
hands
and
assumed
all
sorts
attitudes
was
all
appearance
once
more
young
man
Since
had
known
him
never
had
been
amiable
and
pleasant
followed
him
rather
curious
know
whether
had
made
any
mistake
estimation
our
position

soon
had
reached
the
rock
uncle
took
the
compass
placed
horizontally
before
him
and
looked
keenly
the
needle

had
first
shaken
give
vivacity
oscillated
considerably
and
then
slowly
assumed
its
right
position
under
the
influence
the
magnetic
power

The
Professor
bent
his
eyes
curiously
over
the
wondrous
instrument
violent
start
immediately
showed
the
extent
his
emotion

closed
his
eyes
rubbed
them
and
took
another
and
keener
survey

Then
turned
slowly
round
stupefaction
depicted
his
countenance

What
the
matter
said
beginning
alarmed

could
not
speak
was
too
overwhelmed
for
words
simply
pointed
the
instrument

examined
eagerly
according
his
mute
directions
and
loud
cry
surprise
escaped
lips
The
needle
the
compass
pointed
due
north—in
the
direction
expected
was
the
south

pointed
the
shore
instead
the
high
seas

shook
the
compass
examined
with
curious
and
anxious
eye
was
state
perfection
blemish
any
way
explained
the
phenomenon
Whatever
position
forced
the
needle
into
returned
invariably
the
same
unexpected
point

was
useless
attempting
conceal
from
ourselves
the
fatal
truth

There
could
doubt
about
unwelcome
was
the
fact
that
during
the
tempest
there
had
been
sudden
slant
wind
which
had
been
unable
take
any
account
and
thus
the
raft
had
carried
back
the
shores

left
apparently
forever

days
before

would
altogether
impossible
for
give
any
idea
the
utter
astonishment
which
overcame
the
Professor
making
this
extraordinary
discovery
Amazement
incredulity
and
rage
were
blended
such
way
alarm
During
the
whole
course
Life
had
never
seen
man
first
chapfallen
and
then
furiously
indignant

The
terrible
fatigues
our
sea
voyage
the
fearful
dangers
had
passed
through
had
all
all
gone
for
nothing
had
begin
them
all
over
again

Instead
progressing
fondly
expected
during
voyage
many
days
had
retreated
Every
hour
our
expedition
the
raft
had
been
much
lost
time

Presently
however
the
indomitable
energy
uncle
overcame
every
other
consideration

said
between
his
set
teeth
fatality
will
play
these
terrible
tricks
The
elements
themselves
conspire
overwhelm
with
mortification
Air

and
water
combine
their
united
efforts

Well
they
shall
see
what
the
earnest
will
determined
man
can
will
not
yield
will
not
retreat
even
one
inch
and
shall
see
who
shall
triumph
this
great
contest—man

Standing
upright

irritated
and
menacing
Professor
Hardwigg
like
the
ferocious
Ajax
seemed
defy
the
fates
however
took
upon
myself
interfere
and
impose
some
sort
check
upon
such
insensate
enthusiasm

mere
plaything
the

and

part
madmen
second
time
run
any
risk
upon
this
dangerous
and
treacherous
Central
Sea

These
are
only
few
the
reasons
and
arguments
put
together—reasons
and
arguments
which
appeared
unanswerable
was
allowed
without
interruption
for
about
ten
minutes
The
explanation
this
soon
discovered
The
Professor
was
not
even
listening
and
did
not
hear
word
all
eloquence

the
raft
cried
hoarse
voice
when
paused
for
reply

Such
was
the
result
strenuous
effort
resist
his
iron
will
tried
again
begged
and
implored
him
got
into
passion
but
had
deal
with
will
more
determined
than
own
seemed
feel
like
the
waves
which
fought
and
battled
against
the
huge
mass
granite
our
feet
which
had
smiled
grimly
for
many
ages
their
puny
efforts

Hans
meanwhile
without
taking
part
our
discussion
had
been
repairing
the
raft
One
would
have
supposed
that
instinctively
guessed
the
further
projects
uncle

means
some
fragments
cordage
had
again
made
the
raft
seaworthy

While
had
been
speaking
had
hoisted
new
mast
and
sail
the
latter
already
fluttering
and
waving
the
breeze

The
worthy
Professor
spoke
few
words
our
imperturbable
guide
who
immediately
began
put
our
baggage
board
and
prepare
for
our
departure
The
atmosphere
was
now
tolerably
clear
and
pure
and
the
northeast
wind
blew
steadily
and
serenely
appeared
likely
last
for
some
time

What
then
could
Could
undertake
resist
the
iron
will
two
men
was
simply
impossible
even
could
have
hoped
for
the
support
Hans
This
however
was
out
the
question
appeared
that
the
Icelander
had
set
aside
all
personal
will
and
identity
was
picture
abnegation

could
hope
for
nothing
from
one
infatuated
with
and
devoted
his
master
All
could
therefore
was
swim
with
the
stream

mood
stolid
and
sullen
resignation
was
about
take
accustomed
place
the
raft
when
uncle
placed
his
hand
upon
shoulder

There
hurry
boy
said
shall
not
start
until
tomorrow

looked
the
picture
resignation
the
dire
will
fate

Under
the
circumstances
said
ought
neglect
precautions
fate
has
cast
upon
these
shores
shall
not
leave
without
having
completely
examined
them

order
understand
this
remark
must
explain
that
though
had
been
driven
back
the
northern
shore
had
landed
very
different
spot
from
that
which
had
been
our
starting
point

Port
Gretchen
must
calculated
very
much
the
westward
Nothing
therefore
was
more
natural
and
reasonable
than
that
should
reconnoiter
this
new
shore
upon
which
had
unexpectedly
landed

Let
journey
discovery
cried

And
leaving
Hans
his
important
operation
started
our
expedition
The
distance
between
the
foreshore
high
water
and
the
foot
the
rocks
was
considerable
would
take
about
half
hour's
walking
get
from
one
the
other

trudged
along
our
feet
crushed
innumerable
shells
every
shape
and
size—once
the
dwelling
place
animals
every
period
creation

particularly
noticed
some
enormous
shells—carapaces
turtle
and
tortoise
species
the
diameter
which
exceeded
fifteen
feet

They
had
past
ages
belonged
those
gigantic
Glyptodons
the
Pliocene
period
which
the
modern
turtle
but
minute
specimen
addition
the
whole
soil
was
covered
vast
quantity
stony
relics
having
the
appearance
flints
worn
the
action
the
waves
and
lying
successive
layers
one
above
the
other
came
the
conclusion
that
past
ages
the
sea
must
have
covered
the
whole
district
Upon
the
scattered
rocks
now
lying
far
beyond
its
reach
the
mighty
waves
ages
had
left
evident
marks
their
passage

reflection
this
appeared
partially
explain
the
existence
this
remarkable
ocean
forty
leagues
below
the
surface
the
earth's
crust
According
new
and
perhaps
fanciful
theory
this
liquid
mass
must
gradually
lost
the
deep
bowels
the
earth
had
also
doubt
that
this
mysterious
sea
was
fed
infiltration
the
ocean
above
through
imperceptible
fissures

Nevertheless
was
impossible
not
admit
that
these
fissures
must
now
nearly
choked
for
not
the
cavern
rather
the
immense
and
stupendous
reservoir
would
have
been
completely
filled
short
space
time
Perhaps
even
this
water
having
contend
against
the
accumulated
subterraneous
fires
the
interior
the
earth
had
become
partially
vaporized
Hence
the
explanation
those
heavy
clouds
suspended
over
our
heads
and
the
superabundant
display
that
electricity
which
occasioned
such
terrible
storms
this
deep
and
cavernous
sea

This
lucid
explanation
the
phenomena
had
witnessed
appeared
quite
satisfactory
However
great
and
mighty
the
marvels
nature
may
seem
they
are
always
explained
physical
reasons
Everything
subordinate
some
great
law
nature

now
appeared
clear
that
were
walking
upon
kind
sedimentary
soil
formed
like
all
the
soils
that
period
frequent
the
surface
the
globe
the
subsidence
the
waters
The
Professor
who
was
now
his
element
carefully
examined
every
rocky
fissure
Let
him
only
find
opening
and
directly
became
important
him
examine
its
depth

For
whole
mile
followed
the
windings
the
Central
Sea
when
suddenly
important
change
took
place
the
aspect
the
soil
seemed
have
been
rudely
cast
convulsionized
were
violent
upheaving
the
lower
strata
many
places
hollows
here
and
hillocks
there
attested
great
dislocations
some
other
period
the
terrestrial
mass

advanced
with
great
difficulty
over
the
broken
masses
granite
mixed
with
flint
quartz
and
alluvial
deposits
when
large
field
more
even
than
field
plain
bones
appeared
suddenly
before
our
eyes
looked
like
immense
cemetery
where
generation
after
generation
had
mingled
their
mortal
dust

Lofty
barrows
early
remains
rose
intervals
They
undulated
away
the
limits
the
distant
horizon
and
were
lost
thick
and
brown
fog

that
spot
some
three
square
miles
extent
was
accumulated
the
whole
history
animal
life—scarcely
one
creature
upon
the
comparatively
modern
soil
the
upper
and
inhabited
world
had
not
there
existed

Nevertheless
were
drawn
forward
all-absorbing
and
impatient
curiosity
Our
feet
crushed
with
dry
and
crackling
sound
the
remains
those
prehistoric
fossils
for
which
the
museums
great
cities
quarrel
even
when
they
obtain
only
rare
and
curious
morsels
thousand

Cuvier
would
not
have
sufficed
recompose
the
skeletons
the
organic
beings
which
lay
this
magnificent
osseous
collection

was
utterly
confounded
uncle
stood
for
some
minutes
with
his
arms
raised
high
towards
the
thick
granite
vault
which
served
for
sky
His
mouth
was
wide
open
his
eyes
sparkled
wildly
behind
his
spectacles
which
had
fortunately
saved
his
head
bobbed
and
down
and
from
side
side
while
his
whole
attitude
and
mien
expressed
unbounded
astonishment

stood
the
presence
endless
wondrous
and
inexhaustibly
rich

antediluvian
monsters
piled
for
his
own
private
and
peculiar
satisfaction

Fancy

into
the
very
midst
the
famous

the
sacrilegious

and
which
some
miracle
had
restored
its
pristine
splendor
Such
was
something
the
state
mind
which
Uncle
Hardwigg
was
now
placed

For
some
time
stood
thus
literally
aghast
the
magnitude
his
discovery

But
was
even
greater
excitement
when
darting
wildly
over
this
mass
organic

caught
naked

and

order
fully

the
exclamation
made

and
his
allusions
these
illustrious
and
learned

will
necessary
enter
into
certain
explanations
regard

the
highest
importance
paleontology
the
science

which
had
taken
place
short
time
before
our
departure
from
the
upper
regions
the
earth

the
March
some
navigators
under
the
direction
Boucher
Perthes
were
work
the
great
quarries
Moulin-Quignon
near
Abbeville
the
department
the
Somme
France
While
work
they
unexpectedly
came
upon
human
jawbone
buried
fourteen
feet
below
the
surface
the
soil
was
the
first
fossil
the
kind
that
had
ever
been
brought
the
light
day
Near
this
unexpected
human
relic
were
found
stone
hatchets
and
carved
flints
colored
and
clothed
time
one
uniform
brilliant
tint
verdigris

The
report
this
extraordinary
and
unexpected
discovery
spread
not
only
all
over
France
but
over
England
and
Germany
Many
learned
men
belonging
various
scientific
bodies
and
noteworthy
among
others
Messrs
Milne-Edwards
and
Quatrefages
took
the
affair
very
much
heart
demonstrated
the
incontestable
authenticity
the
bone
question
and
became—to
use
the
phrase
then
recognized
England—the
most
ardent
supporters
the
jawbone
question

the
eminent
geologists
the
United
Kingdom
who
looked
upon
the
fact
certain—Messrs
Falconer
Buck
Carpenter
and
others—were
soon
united
the
learned
men
Germany
and
among
those
the
first
rank
the
most
eager
the
most
enthusiastic
was
worthy
uncle
Professor
Hardwigg

The
authenticity
human
fossil
the
Quaternary
period
seemed
then
incontestably
demonstrated
and
even
admitted
the
most
skeptical

This
system
theory
call
what
you
will
had
true
bitter
adversary
Elie
Beaumont
This
learned
man
who
holds
such
high
place
the
scientific
world
holds
that
the
soil
Moulin-Quignon
does
not
belong
the
diluvium
but
much
less
ancient
stratum
and
accordance
with
Cuvier
this
respect
would
means
admit
that
the
human
species
was
contemporary
with
the
animals
the
Quaternary
epoch
worthy
uncle
Professor
Hardwigg
concert
with
the
great
majority
geologists
had
held
firm
had
disputed
discussed
and
finally
after
considerable
talking
and
writing
Elie
Beaumont
had
been
pretty
well
left
alone
his
opinions

were
familiar
with
all
the
details
this
discussion
but
were
far
from
being
aware
then
that
since
our
departure
the
matter
had
entered
upon
new
phase
Other
similar
jawbones
though
belonging
individuals
varied
types
and
very
different
natures
had
been
found
the
movable
grey
sands
certain
grottoes
France
Switzerland
and
Belgium
together
with
arms
utensils
tools
bones
children
men
the
prime
life
and
old
men
The
existence
men
the
Quaternary
period
became
therefore
more
positive
every
day

But
this
was
far
from
being
all
New
remains
dug
from
the
Pliocene
Tertiary
deposits
had
enabled
the
more
far-seeing
audacious
among
learned
men
assign
even
far
greater
degree
antiquity
the
human
race
These
remains
true
were
not
those
men
that
were
not
the
bones
men
but
objects
decidedly
having
served
the
human
race:
shinbones
thighbones
fossil
animals
regularly
scooped
out
and

our

before

will
now
easy
understand
the
Professor's
mingled
astonishment
and
joy
when
advancing
about
twenty
yards
found
himself
the
presence
may
say
face
face
with
specimen
the
human
race
actually
belonging
the
Quaternary
period

was
indeed
human
skull
perfectly
recognizable
Had
soil
very
peculiar
nature
like
that
the
cemetery
Michel
Bordeaux
preserved
during
countless
ages
This
was
the
question
asked
myself
but
which
was
wholly
unable
answer
But
this
head
with
stretched
and
parchmenty
skin
with
the
teeth
whole
the
hair
abundant
was
before
our
eyes
life

stood
mute
almost
paralyzed
with
wonder
and
awe
before
this
dread
apparition
another
age
uncle
who
almost
every
occasion
was
great
talker
remained
for
time
completely
dumfounded
was
too
full
emotion
for
speech
possible
After
while
however
raised
the
body
which
the
skull
belonged
stood
end
seemed
our
excited
imaginations
look
with
its
terrible
hollow
eyes

After
some
minutes
silence
the
man
was
vanquished
the
Professor
Human
instincts
succumbed
scientific
pride
and
exultation
Professor
Hardwigg
carried
away
his
enthusiasm
forgot
all
the
circumstances
our
journey
the
extraordinary
position
which
were
placed
the
immense
cavern
which
stretched
far
away
over
our
heads
There
can
doubt
that
thought
himself
the
Institution
addressing
his
attentive
pupils
for
put
his
most
doctorial
style
waved
his
hand
and
began:

Gentlemen
have
the
honor
this
auspicious
occasion
present
you
man
the
Quaternary

Many
learned
men
have
denied
his
very
existence
while
other
able
persons
perhaps
even

authority
have
affirmed
their
belief
the
reality

Thomases

were
present
they
would
reverentially
touch
him
with
their

and
believe
his
existence
thus
acknowledging
their
obstinate
heresy

that

not

Impossible
The

There

the

exclaimed
Professor
Hardwigg
between
two
savage
growls

Having
got
over
our
difficulty
and
getting
more
and
more
excited—

Yes
gentlemen
well

with
all
these
matters
and
know
also
that
Cuvier
and
Blumenbach
fully
recognized

But
after

this

But
without

Nevertheless
such
this

will
tell
its

nobody
smiled
But

Professor
was

beaming
countenances

lectures
that
believed

all
his
audience
laughing
during

Doubtless
carry
ourselves
back
the
Quaternary
epoch
shall
find
that
great
and
mighty
convulsions
took

earth

continually
cooling
operation
through
which
the
earth
had
pass

fissures

and
chasms
through
which
large
portion
the
earth
made
its
way
come
absolute
conclusion
but
there
the
man
surrounded
the
works
his
hands
his
hatchets
and
his
carved
flints
which
belong
the
stony
period
and
the
only
rational
supposition
that
like
myself
visited
the
centre
the
earth
traveling
tourist
pioneer
science
all
events
there
can
doubt
his
great
age
and
his
being
one
the
oldest
race
human
beings

The
Professor
with
these
words
ceased
his
oration
and
burst
forth
into
loud
and
unanimous
applause
Besides
after
all
uncle
was
right
Much
more
learned
men
than
his
nephew
would
have
found
rather
hard
refute
his
facts
and
arguments

Another
circumstance
soon
presented
itself
This
fossilized
body
was
not
the
only
one
this
vast
plain
bones—the
cemetery
extinct
world
Other
bodies
were
found
trod
the
dusty
plain
and
uncle
was
able
choose
the
most
marvelous
these
specimens
order
convince
the
most
incredulous

truth
was
surprising
spectacle
the
successive
remains
generations
and
generations
men
and
animals
confounded
together
one
vast
cemetery
But
great
question
now
presented
itself
our
notice
and
one
were
actually
afraid
contemplate
all
its
bearings

Had
these
once
animated
beings
been
buried
far
beneath
the
soil
some
tremendous
convulsion
nature
after
they
had
been
earth
earth
and
ashes
ashes
had
they
lived
here
below
this
subterranean
world
under
this
factitious
sky
borne
married
and
given
marriage
and
died
last
just
like
ordinary
inhabitants
the
earth

the
present
moment
marine
monsters
fish
and
suchlike
animals
had
alone
been
seen
alive

The
question
which
rendered
rather
uneasy
was
pertinent
one
Were
any
these
men
the
abyss
wandering
about
the
deserted
shores
this
wondrous
sea
the
centre
the
earth

This
was
question
which
rendered
very
uneasy
and
uncomfortable
How
should
they
really
existence
would
they
receive
men
from
above

CHAPTER
WHAT
For
long
and
weary
hour
tramped
over
this
great
bed
bones
advanced
regardless
everything
drawn
ardent
curiosity
What
other
marvels
did
this
great
cavern
contain—what
other
wondrous
treasures
for
the
scientific
man
eyes
were
quite
prepared
for
any
number
surprises
imagination
lived
expectation
something
new
and
wonderful

The
borders
the
great
Central
Ocean
had
for
some
time
disappeared
behind
the
hills
that
were
scattered
over
the
ground
occupied
the
plain
bones
The
imprudent
and
enthusiastic
Professor
who
did
not
care
whether
lost
himself
not
hurried
forward
advanced
silently
bathed
waves
electric
fluid

reason
phenomenon
which
cannot
explain
and
thanks
its
extreme
diffusion
now
complete
the
light
illumined
equally
the
sides
every
hill
and
rock
Its
seat
appeared
nowhere
determined
force
and
produced
shade
whatever

The
appearance
presented
was
that
tropical
country
midday
summer—in
the
midst
the
equatorial
regions
and
under
the
vertical
rays
the
sun

All
signs
vapor
had
disappeared
The
rocks
the
distant
mountains
some
confused
masses
far-off
forests
assumed
weird
and
mysterious
aspect
under
this
equal
distribution
the
luminous
fluid

resembled
certain
extent
the
mysterious
personage
one
Hoffmann's
fantastic
tales—the
man
who
lost
his
shadow

After
had
walked
about
mile
farther
came
the
edge
vast
forest
not
however
one
the
vast
mushroom
forests
had
discovered
near
Port
Gretchen

was
the
glorious
and
wild
vegetation
the
Tertiary
period
all
its
superb
magnificence
Huge
palms
species
now
unknown
superb
palmacites—a
genus
fossil
palms
from
the
coal
formation—pines
yews
cypress
and
conifers
cone-bearing
trees
the
whole
bound
together
inextricable
and
complicated
mass
creeping
plants

beautiful
carpet
mosses
and
ferns
grew
beneath
the
trees
Pleasant
brooks
murmured
beneath
umbrageous
boughs
little
worthy
this
name
for
shade
did
they
give
Upon
their
borders
grew
small
treelike
shrubs
such
are
seen
the
hot
countries
our
own
inhabited
globe

The
one
thing
wanting
these
plants
these
shrubs
these
trees—was
color
Forever
deprived
the
vivifying
warmth
the
sun
they
were
vapid
and
colorless
All
shade
was
lost
one
uniform
tint
brown
and
faded
character
The
leaves
were
wholly
devoid
verdure
and
the
flowers
numerous
during
the
Tertiary
period
which
gave
them
birth
were
without
color
and
without
perfume
something
like
paper
discolored
long
exposure
the
atmosphere

uncle
ventured
beneath
the
gigantic
groves
followed
him
though
not
without
certain
amount
apprehension
Since
nature
had
shown
herself
capable
producing
such
stupendous
vegetable
supplies
why
might
not
meet
with
mammals
just
large
and
therefore
dangerous

particularly
remarked
the
clearings
left
trees
that
had
fallen
and
been
partially
consumed
time
many
leguminous
beanlike
shrubs
such
the
maple
and
other
eatable
trees
dear
ruminating
animals
Then
there
appeared
confounded
together
and
intermixed
the
trees
such
varied
lands
specimens
the
vegetation
every
part
the
globe
there
was
the
oak
near
the
palm
tree
the
Australian
eucalyptus
interesting
class
the
order
Myrtaceae—leaning
against
the
tall
Norwegian
pine
the
poplar
the
north
mixing
its
branches
with
those
the
New
Zealand
kauris
was
enough
drive
the
most
ingenious
classifier
the
upper
regions
out
his
mind
and
upset
all
his
received
ideas
about
botany

Suddenly
stopped
short
and
restrained
uncle

The
extreme
diffuseness
the
light
enabled
see
the
smallest
objects
the
distant
copses
thought
saw—no
really
did
see
with
own
eyes—immense
gigantic
animals
moving
about
under
the
mighty
trees
Yes
they
were
truly
gigantic
animals
whole
herd
mastodons
not
fossils
but
living
and
exactly
like
those
discovered
the
marshy
banks
the
great
Ohio
North
America

Yes
could
see
these
enormous
elephants
whose
trunks
were
tearing
down
large
boughs
and
working
and
out
the
trees
like
legion
serpents
could
hear
the
sounds
the
mighty
tusks
uprooting
huge
trees

The
boughs
crackled
and
the
whole
masses
leaves
and
green
branches
went
down
the
capacious
throats
these
terrible
monsters

That
wondrous
dream
when
saw
the
antehistorical
times
revivified
when
the
Tertiary
and
Quaternary
periods
passed
before
was
now
realized

And
there
were
alone
far
down
the
bowels
the
earth
the
mercy
its
ferocious
inhabitants

uncle
paused
full
wonder
and
astonishment

Come
said
last
when
his
first
surprise
was
over
Come
along
boy
and
let
see
them
nearer

replied
restraining
his
efforts
drag
forward
are
wholly
without
arms
What
should
the
midst
that
flock
gigantic
quadrupeds
Come
away
Uncle
implore
you
human
creature
can
with
impunity
brave
the
ferocious
anger
these
monsters

human
creature
said
uncle
suddenly
lowering
his
voice
mysterious
whisper
you
are
mistaken
dear
Henry
Look
look
yonder
seems
that
behold
human
being—a
being
like
ourselves—a
man

looked
shrugging
shoulders
decided
push
incredulity
its
very
last
limits
But
whatever
might
have
been
wish
was
compelled
yield
the
weight
ocular
demonstration

Yes—not
more
than
quarter
mile
off
leaning
against
the
trunk
enormous
tree
was
human
being—a
Proteus
these
subterranean
regions
new
son
Neptune
keeping
this
innumerable
herd
mastodons

Immanis
pecoris
custos
immanior
ipse[5]

The
keeper
gigantic
cattle
himself
still
more
gigantic

Yes—it
was
longer
fossil
whose
corpse
had
raised
from
the
ground
the
great
cemetery
but
giant
capable
guiding
and
driving
these
prodigious
monsters
His
height
was
above
twelve
feet
His
head
big
the
head
buffalo
was
lost
mane
matted
hair
was
indeed
huge
mane
like
those
which
belonged
the
elephants
the
earlier
ages
the
world

his
hand
was
branch
tree
which
served
crook
for
this
antediluvian
shepherd

remained
profoundly
still
speechless
with
surprise

But
might
any
moment
seen
him
Nothing
remained
for
but
instant
flight

Come
come
cried
dragging
uncle
along
and
for
the
first
time
made
resistance
wishes

quarter
hour
later
were
far
away
from
that
terrible
monster

Now
that
think
the
matter
calmly
and
that
reflect
upon
dispassionately
now
that
months
years
have
passed
since
this
strange
and
unnatural
adventure
befell
us—what
think
what
believe

utterly
impossible
Our
ears
must
have
deceived
and
our
eyes
have
cheated
have
not
seen
what
believed
had
seen
human
being
could
any
possibility
have
existed
that
subterranean
world
generation
men
could
inhabit
the
lower
caverns
the
globe
without
taking
note
those
who
peopled
the
surface
without
communication
with
them
was
folly
folly
folly
nothing
else

rather
inclined
admit
the
existence
some
animal
resembling
structure
the
human
race—of
some
monkey
the
first
geological
epochs
like
that
discovered
Lartet
the
ossiferous
deposit
Sansan

But
this
animal
being
whichsoever
was
surpassed
height
all
things
known
modern
science
Never
mind
However
unlikely
may
might
have
been
monkey—but
man
living
man
and
with
him
whole
generation
gigantic
animals
buried
the
entrails
the
earth—it
was
too
monstrous
believed

CHAPTER
THE
MYSTERIOUS
DAGGER

During
this
time
had
left
the
bright
and
transparent
forest
far
behind
were
mute
with
astonishment
overcome
kind
feeling
which
was
next
door
apathy
kept
running
spite
ourselves
was
perfect
Right
which
resembled
one
those
horrible
sensations
sometimes
meet
with
our
dreams

Instinctively
made
our
way
towards
the
Central
Sea
and
cannot
now
tell
what
wild
thoughts
passed
through
mind
nor
what
follies
might
have
been
guilty
but
for
very
serious
preoccupation
which
brought
back
practical
life

Though
was
aware
that
were
treading
soil
quite
new
however
every
now
and
then
noticed
certain
aggregations
rock
the
shape
which
forcibly
reminded
those
near
Port
Gretchen

This
confirmed
moreover
the
indications
the
compass
and
our
extraordinary
and
unlooked-for
well
involuntary
return
the
north
this
great
Central
Sea
was
like
our
starting
point
that
could
scarcely
doubt
the
reality
our
position
Streams
and
cascades
fell
hundreds
over
the
numerous
projections
the
rocks

actually
thought
could
see
our
faithful
and
monotonous
Hans
and
the
wonderful
grotto
which
had
come
back
life
after
tremendous
fall

Then
advanced
still
farther
the
position
the
cliffs
the
appearance
stream
the
unexpected
profile
rock
threw
again
into
state
bewildering
doubt

After
some
time
explained
state
mental
indecision
uncle
confessed
similar
feeling
hesitation
was
totally
unable
make
his
mind
the
midst
this
extraordinary
but
uniform
panorama

There
can
doubt
insisted
that
have
not
landed
exactly
the
place
whence
first
took
our
departure
but
the
tempest
has
brought
above
our
starting
point
think
therefore
that
follow
the
coast
shall
once
more
find
Port
Gretchen

that
case
cried
uncle
useless
continue
our
exploration
The
very
best
thing
can
make
our
way
back
the
raft
Are
you
quite
sure
Harry
that
you
are
not
mistaken

difficult
was
reply
come
any
decision
for
all
these
rocks
are
exactly
alike
There
marked
difference
between
them
the
same
time
the
impression
mind
that
recognize
the
promontory
the
foot
which
our
worthy
Hans
constructed
the
raft
are
nearly
convinced
near
the
little
port:
this
not
added
carefully
examining
creek
which
appeared
singularly
familiar
mind

dear
Harry—if
this
were
the
case
should
find
traces
our
own
footsteps
some
signs
our
passage
and
can
really
see
nothing
indicate
our
having
passed
this
way

But
see
something
cried
impetuous
tone
voice
rushed
forward
and
eagerly
picked
something
which
shone
the
sand
under
feet

What
cried
the
astonished
and
bewildered
Professor

This
was
reply

And
handed
startled
relative
rusty
dagger
singular
shape

What
made
you
bring
with
you
useless
weapon
exclaimed
was
needlessly
hampering
yourself

bring
quite
new
never
saw
before—are
you
sure
not
out
your
collection

Not
that
know
said
the
Professor
puzzled
have
recollection
the
circumstance
was
never
property

This
very
extraordinary
said
musing
over
the
novel
and
singular
incident

Not
all
There
very
simple
explanation
Harry
The
Icelanders
are
known
keep
the
use
these
antiquated
weapons
and
this
must
have
belonged
Hans
who
has
let
fall
without
knowing
shook
head
That
dagger
had
never
been
the
possession
the
pacific
and
taciturn
Hans
knew
him
and
his
habits
too
well

Then
what
can
be—unless
the
weapon
some
antediluvian
warrior
continued
some
living
man
contemporary
that
mighty
shepherd
from
whom
have
just
escaped
But
no—mystery
upon
mystery—this
weapon
the
stony
epoch
nor
even
the
bronze
period
made
excellent
steel—

Ere
could
finish
sentence
uncle
stopped
short
from
entering
upon
whole
train
theories
and
spoke
his
most
cold
and
decided
tone
voice

Calm
yourself
dear
boy
and
endeavor
use
your
reason
This
weapon
upon
which
have
fallen
unexpectedly
true
dague
one
those
worn
gentlemen
their
belts
during
the
sixteenth
century
Its
use
was
give
the
coup
grace
the
final
blow
the
foe
who
would
not
surrender
clearly
Spanish
workmanship
belongs
neither
you
nor
nor
the
eider-down
hunter
nor
any
the
living
beings
who
may
still
exist
marvelously
the
interior
the
earth

What
can
you
mean
Uncle
said
now
lost
host
surmises

Look
closely
continued
these
jagged
edges
were
never
made
the
resistance
human
blood
and
bone
The
blade
covered
with
regular
coating
iron
mold
and
rust
which
not
day
old
not
year
old
not
century
old
but
much
more—

The
Professor
began
get
quite
excited
according
custom
and
was
allowing
himself
carried
away
his
fertile
imagination
could
have
said
something
stopped
Harry
cried
are
now
the
verge
great
discovery
This
blade
dagger
you
have
marvelously
discovered
after
being
abandoned
upon
the
sand
for

than

But
this
poniard
never

here
itself
exclaimed
could
not
have
twisted
itself
Someone
therefore
must
have
preceded
upon
the
shores
this
extraordinary
sea

Yes
man

But
what
man
has
been
sufficiently
desperate
such
thing

man
who
has
somewhere
written
his
name
with
this
very
dagger—a
man
who
has
endeavored
once
more
indicate
the
right
road
the
interior
the
earth
Let
look
around
boy
You
know
not
the
importance
your
singular
and
happy
discovery

Prodigiously
interested
walked
along
the
wall

examining
the
smallest
fissures
which
might
finally
expand
into
the
much
wished—for
gully

last
reached
spot
where
the
shore
became
extremely
narrow
The
sea
almost
bathed
the
foot
the
rocks
which
were
here
very
lofty
and
steep
There
was
scarcely

than
two
yards

worn

CHAPTER
OUTLET—BLASTING
THE
ROCK

Ever
since
the
commencement
our
marvelous
journey
had
experienced
many
surprises
had
suffered
from
many
illusions
thought
that
was
case-hardened
against
all
surprises
and
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
amaze
again

was
like
many
who
having
been
round
the
world
finds
himself
wholly
blase
and
proof
against
the
marvelous

When
however
saw
these
two
letters
which
had
been
engraven
three
hundred
years
before
stood
fixed
attitude
mute
surprise

Not
only
was
there
the
signature
the
learned
and
enterprising
alchemist
written
the
rock
but
held
hand
the
very
identical
instrument
with
which
had
laboriously
engraved
was
impossible
without
showing
amount
incredulity
scarcely
becoming
sane
man
deny
the
existence
the
traveler
and
the
reality
that
voyage
which
believed
all
along
have
been
myth—the
mystification
some
fertile
brain

While
these
reflections
were
passing
through
mind
uncle
the
Professor
gave
way
access
feverish
and
poetical
excitement

Wonderful
and
glorious
genius
great
Saknussemm
cried
you
have
left
stone
unturned
resource
omitted
show
other
mortals
the
way
into
the
interior
our
mighty
globe
and
your
fellow
creatures
can
find
the
trail
left
your
illustrious
footsteps
three
hundred
years
ago
the
bottom
these
obscure
subterranean
abodes
You
have
been
careful
secure
for
others
the
contemplation
these
wonders
and
marvels
creation
Your
name
engraved
every
important
stage
your
glorious
journey
leads
the
hopeful
traveler
direct
the
great
and
mighty
discovery
which
you
devoted
such
energy
and
courage
The
audacious
traveler
who
shall
follow
your
footsteps
the
last
will
doubtless
find
your
initials
engraved
with
your
own
hand
upon
the
centre
the
earth
will
that
audacious
traveler—I
too
will
sign
name
upon
the
very
same
spot
upon
the
central
granite
stone
this
wondrous
work
the
Creator
But
justice
your
devotion
your
courage
and
your
being
the
first
indicate
the
road
let
this
cape
seen
you
upon
the
shores
this
sea
discovered
you
called
all
time
Cape
Saknussemm

This
what
heard
and
began
roused
the
pitch
enthusiasm
indicated
those
words
fierce
excitement
roused
forgot
everything
The
dangers
the
voyage
and
the
perils
the
return
journey
were
now
nothing

What
another
man
had
done
ages
past
could
felt
done
again
was
determined
myself
and
now
nothing
that
man
had
accomplished
appeared
impossible

Forward—forward
cried
burst
genuine
and
hearty
enthusiasm

had
already
started
the
direction
the
somber
and
gloomy
gallery
when
the
Professor
stopped
the
man
rash
and
hasty
the
man
easily
roused
the
highest
pitch
enthusiasm
checked
and
asked
patient
and
show
more
calm

Let
return
our
good
friend
Hans
said
will
then
bring
the
raft
down
this
place

must
say
that
though
once
yielded
uncle's
request
was
not
without
dissatisfaction
and
hastened
along
the
rocks
that
wonderful
coast

you
know
dear
uncle
said
walked
along
that
have
been
singularly
helped
concurrence
circumstances
right
this
very
moment

you
begin
see
you
Harry
said
the
Professor
with
smile

Doubtless
responded
and
strangely
enough
even
the
tempest
has
been
the
means
putting
the
right
road
Blessings
the
tempest
brought
safely
back
the
very
spot
from
which
fine
weather
would
have
driven
forever
Supposing
had
succeeded
reaching
the
southern
and
distant
shores
this
extraordinary
sea
what
would
have
become
The
name
Saknussemm
would
never
have
appeared
and
this
moment
should
have
been
cast
away
upon
inhospitable
coast
probably
without
outlet

Yes
Harry
boy
there
certainly
something
providential
that
wandering
the
mercy
wind
and
waves
towards
the
south:
have
come
back
exactly
north
and
what
better
still
fall
upon
this
great
discovery
Cape
Saknussemm
mean
say
that
more
than
surprising
there
something
which
far
beyond
comprehension
The
coincidence
unheard
marvelous

What
matter
not
our
duty
explain
facts
but
make
the
best
possible
use
them

Doubtless
boy
but
you
will
allow
me—
said
the
really
delighted
Professor

Excuse
sir
but
see
exactly
how
will
shall
take
the
northern
route
shall
pass
under
the
northern
regions
Europe
under
Sweden
under
Russia
under
Siberia
and
who
knows
where—instead
burying
ourselves
under
the
burning
plains
and
deserts
Africa
beneath
the
mighty
waves
the
ocean
and
that
all
this
stage
our
journey
that
care

Let
advance
and
Heaven
will
our
guide

Yes
Harry
you
are
right
quite
right
all
for
the
best
Let
abandon
this
horizontal
sea
which
could
never
have
led
anything
satisfactory
shall
descend
descend
and
everlastingly
descend
you
know
dear
boy
that

thousand
miles

Bah
cried

away

distance

worth

about
The

wild
mad
and
incoherent
speeches
continued
until
rejoined
our
patient
and
phlegmatic
guide
All
was
found
prepared
for
immediate
departure
There
was
not
single
parcel
but
what
was
its
proper
place
all
took
our
posts

raft
and
the
sail

hoisted
Hans

his
directions
and

uncle
and
the
Icelander
followed
The
voyage
from
the
port
this
point
the
sea
had
means
calmed
had
rather
produced
the
opposite
effect
even
proposed
burn
our
vessel
that
destroy
our
raft
order
completely
cut
off
our
retreat
But
uncle
sternly
opposed
this
wild
project
began
think
him
particularly
lukewarm
and
unenthusiastic

any
rate
dear
uncle
said
let
start
without
delay

Yes
boy
quite
eager
you
can
But
the
first
place
let
examine
this
mysterious
gallery
order

shall
need
prepare
and
mend
our
ladders

uncle
now
began
see
the
efficiency
our
Ruhmkorff
coil
which
would
doubtless
soon
needed
the
raft
securely
fastened
rock
was
left
alone
Moreover
the
opening
into
the
new
gallery
was
not
twenty
paces
distant
from
the
spot
Our
little
troop
with
myself
the
head
advanced

The
orifice
which
was
almost
circular
presented
diameter
about
five
feet
the
somber
tunnel
was
cut
the
living
rock
and
coated
the
inside
the
different
material
which
had
once
passed
through
state
fusion
The
lower
part
was
about
level
with
the
water
that
were
able
penetrate
the
interior
without
difficulty

followed
almost
horizontal
direction
when
the
end
about
dozen
paces
our
further
advance
was
checked
the
interposition
enormous
block
granite
rock

Accursed

cried
furiously

that

obstacle

There

the
most
bitter

that

But
all

was
necessary
renounce

through

had
seated
myself
upon
the
ground
uncle
walked
angrily
and
hopelessly
and
down
was
evidently
desperate

But
cried
after
some
moments'
thought
what
about
Arne
Saknussemm

You
are
right
replied
uncle
can
never
have
been
checked
lump

No—ten
thousand
times
cried
with
extreme
vivacity
This
huge
lump
rock
consequence
some
singular
concussion
process
one
those
magnetic
phenomena
which
have
often
shaken
the
terrestrial
crust
has
some
unexpected
way
closed
the
passage
Many
and
many
years
have
passed
away
since
the
return
Saknussemm
and
the
fall
this
huge
block
granite
not
quite
evident
that
this
gallery
was
formerly
the
outlet
for
the
pent-up
lava
the
interior

earth
and
that
these
eruptive
matters
then
circulated
freely
Look

recent
fissures

granite
roof
evidently
formed
pieces
enormous
stone
placed
here
the
hand

who
had
worked

One
day
after
unusually
strong
shock
the
vast
rock
which
stands
our
way
and
which
was
doubtless
the
key
kind
arch
fell
through
level
with
the
soil
and
has
barred
our
further
progress
are
right
then
thinking
that
this
unexpected
obstacle
with
which
Saknussemm
did
not
meet
and
not
upset
some
way
are
unworthy
following
the
footsteps
the
great
discoverer
and
incapable
finding
our
way
the
centre
the
earth

this
wild
way
addressed
uncle
The
zeal
the
Professor
his
earnest
longing
for
success
had
become
part
and
parcel
being
wholly
forgot
the
past
utterly
despised
the
future
Nothing
existed
for

the
surface

was
engulfed

not
even

CHAPTER
THE
EXPLOSION
AND
ITS
RESULTS

The
next
day
which
was
the
twenty-seventh
August
was
date
celebrated
our
wondrous
subterranean
journey
never
think
even
now
but
shudder
with
horror
heart
beats
wildly
the
very
memory
that
awful
day

From
this
time
forward
our
reason
our
judgment
our
human
ingenuity
have
nothing
with
the
course
events
are
about
become
the
plaything
the
great
phenomena
the
earth

six
o'clock
were
all
and
ready
The
dreaded
moment
was
arriving
when
were
about
seek
opening
into
the
interior
the
earth
means
gunpowder
What
would
the
consequences
breaking
through
the
crust
the
earth

begged
that
might
duty
set
fire
the
mine
looked
upon
honor
This
task
once
performed
could
rejoin
friends
upon
the
raft
which
had
not
been
unloaded
soon
were
all
ready
were
sail
away
some
distance
avoid
the
consequences
the
explosion
the
effects
which
would
certainly
not
concentrated
the
interior
the
earth

The
slow
match
calculated
burn
for
about
ten
minutes
more
less
before
reached
the
chamber
which
the
great
body
powder
was
confined
should
therefore
have
plenty
time
reach
the
raft
and
put
off
safe
distance

prepared
execute
self-allotted
task—not
must
confessed
without
considerable
emotion

After
hearty
repast
uncle
and
the
hunter-guide
embarked
board
the
raft
while
remained
alone
upon
the
desolate
shore

was
provided
with
lantern
which
was
enable
set
fire
the
wick
the
infernal
machine

boy
said
uncle
and
Heaven
with
you
But
come
back
soon
you
can
shall
all
impatience

easy
that
matter
replied
there
fear
delaying
the
road

Having
said
this
advanced
toward
the
opening
the
somber
gallery
heart
beat
wildly
opened
lantern
and
seized
the
extremity
the
wick

The
Professor
who
was
looking
held
his
chronometer
his
hand

Are
you
ready
cried
Quite
ready

Well
then
fire
away

hastened
put
the
light
the
wick
which
crackled
and
sparkled
hissing
and
spitting
like
serpent
then
running
fast
could
returned
the
shore

Get
board
lad
and
you
Hans
shove
off
cried
uncle

vigorous
application
his
pole
Hans
sent
flying
over
the
water
The
raft
was
quite
twenty
fathoms
distant

was
moment
palpitating
interest
deep
anxiety
uncle
the
Professor
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
chronometer

Only
five
minutes
more
said
low
tone
only
four
only
three

pulse
went
hundred
the
minute
could
hear
heart
beating

Only
two
one
Now
then
mountains
granite
crumble
beneath
the
power
man

What
happened
after
that
the
terrific
roar
the
explosion
not
think
heard
But
the
form
the
rocks
completely
changed
eyes—they
seemed

and
looked

with

and

convulsively

snapped

nothing

could

And
still
the
long
monotonous
hours
went
The
situation
did
not
change
the
least
though
discovery
suddenly
made
seemed
complicate
very
much

When
had
slightly
recovered
our
equilibrium
proceeded
examine
our
cargo
then
made
the
unsatisfactory
discovery
that
the
greater
part
had
utterly
disappeared

became
alarmed
and
determined
discover
what
were
our
resources
heart
beat
the
idea
but
was
absolutely
necessary
know
what
had
depend
With
this
view
took
the
lantern
and
looked
around

all
our
former
collection
nautical
and
philosophical
instruments
there
remained
only
the
chronometer
and
the
compass
The
ladders
and
ropes
were
reduced
small
piece

fastened
the
stump
the
mast
Not
pickax
not
crowbar
not
hammer
and
far
worse
than
all
food—not
enough
for
one
day

This
discovery
was
prelude
certain
and
horrible
death

Seated
gloomily
the
raft
clasping
the
stump
the
mast
mechanically
thought
all
had
read
sufferings
from
starvation

remembered
everything
that
history
had
taught
the
subject
and
shuddered
the
remembrance
the
agonies
endured

Maddened
the
prospects
enduring
the
miseries
starvation
persuaded
myself
that
must
mistaken
examined
the
cracks
the
raft
poked
between
the
joints
and
beams
examined
every
possible
hole
and
corner
The
result
was—simply
nothing

Our
stock
provisions
consisted
nothing
but
piece
dry
meat
and
some
soaked
and
half-moldy
biscuits

gazed
around
scared
and
frightened
could
not
understand
the
awful
truth
And
yet
what
consequence
was
regard
any
new
danger
Supposing
that
had
had
provisions
for
months
and
even
for
years
how
could
ever
get
out
the
awful
abyss
into
which
were
being
hurled
the
irresistible
torrent
had
let
loose

Why
should
trouble
ourselves
about
the
sufferings
and
tortures
endured
from
hunger
when
death
stared
the
face
under
many
other
swifter
and
perhaps
even
more
horrid
forms

was
very
doubtful
under
the
circumstances
which
were
placed
should
have
time
die
inanition

But
the
human
frame
singularly
constituted

know
not
how
was
but
from
some
singular
hallucination
the
mind
forgot
the
real
serious
and
immediate
danger
which
were
exposed
think
the
menaces
the
future
which
appeared
before
all
their
naked
terror
Besides
after
all
suggested
Hope
perhaps
might
finally
escape
the
fury
the
raging
torrent
and
once
more
revisit
the
glimpses
the
moon
the
surface
our
beautiful
Mother
Earth

How
was
done
had
not
the
remotest
idea
Where
were
come
out
matter
that
did

One
chance
thousand
always
chance
while
death
from
hunger
gave
not
even
the
faintest
glimpse
hope
left
the
imagination
nothing
but
blank
horror
without
the
faintest
chance
escape

had
the
greatest
mind
reveal
all
uncle
explain
him
the
extraordinary
and
wretched
position
which
were
reduced
order
that
between
the
two
might
make
calculation
the
exact
space
time
which
remained
for
live

was
appeared
the
only
thing
done
But
had
the
courage
hold
tongue
gnaw
entrails
like
the
Spartan
boy
wished
leave
him
all
his
coolness

this
moment
the
light
the
lantern
slowly
fell
and
last
went
out

The
wick
had
wholly
burnt

The
obscurity
became
absolute
was
longer
possible

through
the
impenetrable
darkness
There
was
one
torch
left
but
was
impossible

alight
Then
like
child
shut
eyes
that
might
not
see
the
darkness

After
great
lapse
time
the
rapidity
our
journey
increased
could
feel
the
rush

upon
face
The
slope
the
waters
was
excessive
began

that

one

felt
that
the

Hans
were
vigorously
clasping

Suddenly
after
lapse
time
scarcely
appreciable
felt
something
like
shock
The
raft
had
not
struck
hard
body
but
had
suddenly
been
checked
its
course

liquid
column
water
fell
upon

suffocating

Still
the
sudden
inundation
did
not

myself
once

able

uncle
and
Hans
pressed

and
the

carried
all
three
away

Gigantic

The
raft
took
sudden
turn
whirled
round
entered
another
tunnel—this
time
illumined
most
singular
manner
The
roof
was
formed
porous
stalactite
through
which
moonlit
vapor
appeared

casting
its
brilliant
light
upon
our
gaunt
and
haggard
figures

did
became
aware
something
moving
the
distance
which
once
fascinated
eyes
was
floating
apparently
upon
the
surface
the
water
advancing
means
what
first
appeared
paddles
looked
with
glaring
eyes
One
glance
told
that
was
something
monstrous

But
what

was
the
great
shark-crocodile
the
early
writers
geology
About
the
size
ordinary
whale
with
hideous
jaws
and
two
gigantic
eyes
advanced
Its
eyes
fixed
with
terrible
sternness
Some
indefinite
warning
told
that
had
marked
for
its
own

attempted
rise—to
escape
matter
where
but
knees
shook
under
limbs
trembled
violently
almost
lost
senses
And
still
the
mighty
monster
advanced
uncle
and
the
guide
made
effort
save
themselves

With
strange
noise
like
none
other
had
ever
heard
the
beast
came
His
jaws
were
least
seven
feet
apart
and
his
distended
mouth
looked
large
enough
have
swallowed
boatful
men

were
about
ten
feet
distant
when
discovered
that
much
his
body
resembled
that
crocodile
his
mouth
was
wholly
that
shark

His
twofold
nature
now
became
apparent
snatch
mouthful
was
necessary
for
him
turn
his
back
which
motion
necessarily
caused
his
legs
kick
helplessly
the
air

actually
laughed
even
the
very
jaws
death

But
next
minute
with
wild
cry
darted
away
into
the
interior
the
cave
leaving
unhappy
comrades
their
fate
This
cavern
was
deep
and
dreary
After
about
hundred
yards
paused
and
looked
around

The
whole
floor
composed
sand
and
malachite
was
strewn
with
bones
freshly
gnawed
bones
reptiles
and
fish
with
mixture
mammalia
very
soul
grew
sick
body
shuddered
with
horror
had
truly
according
the
old
proverb
fallen
out
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
Some
beast
larger
and
more
ferocious
even
than
the
shark-crocodile
inhabited
this
den

What
could
The
mouth
the
cave
was
guarded
one
ferocious
monster
the
interior
was
inhabited
something
too
hideous
contemplate
Flight
was
impossible

Only
one
resource
remained
and
that
was
find
some
small
hiding
place
which
the
fearful
denizens
the
cavern
could
not
penetrate
gazed
wildly
around
and
last
discovered
fissure
the
rock
which
rushed
the
hope
recovering
scattered
senses

Crouching
down
waited
shivering
ague
fit
man
brave
presence
earthquake
bursting
boiler
exploding
torpedo
could
not
expected
feel
much
courage
presence
the
fearful
fate
that
appeared
await
hour
passed
heard
all
the
time
strange
rumbling
outside
the
cave

What
was
the
fate
unhappy
companions
was
impossible
for
pause
inquire
own
wretched
existence
was
all
could
think
Suddenly
groaning
fifty
bears
fight
fell
upon
ears—hisses
spitting
moaning
hideous
hear—and
then
saw—

Never
were
ages
pass
over
head
shall
forget
the
horrible
apparition

was
the
Ape
Gigans

Fourteen
feet
high
covered
with
coarse
hair
blackish
brown
the
hair
the
arms
from
the
shoulder
the
elbow
joints
pointing
downwards
while
that
from
the
wrist
the
elbow
pointed
upwards
advanced
Its
arms
were
long
its
body
while
its
legs
were
prodigious
had
thick
long
and
sharply
pointed
teeth—like
mammoth
saw

struck
its
breast
came
smelling
and
sniffing
reminding
the
stories
read
our
early
childhood
giants
who
ate
the
Flesh
men
and
little
boys

Suddenly
stopped
heart
beat
wildly
for
was
conscious
that
somehow
other
the
fearful
monster
had
smelled
out
and
was
peering
about
with
his
hideous
eyes
try
and
discover
whereabouts

reading
which
rule
blessing
but
which
this
occasion
seemed
momentarily
prove
curse
told
the
real
truth
was
the
Ape
Gigans
the
antediluvian
gorilla

Yes
This
awful
monster
confined
good
fortune
the
interior
the
earth
was
the
progenitor
the
hideous
monster
Africa

glared
wildly
about
seeking
something—doubtless
myself
gave
myself
for
lost
hope
safety
escape
seemed
remain

this
moment
just
eyes
appeared
close
death
there
came
strange
noise
from
the
entrance
the
cave
and
turning
the
gorilla
evidently
recognized
some
enemy
more
worthy
his
prodigious
size
and
strength
was
the
huge
shark-crocodile
which
perhaps
having
disposed
friends
was
coming
search
further
prey

The
gorilla
placed
himself
the
defensive
and
clutching
bone
some
seven
eight
feet
length
perfect
club
aimed
deadly
blow
the
hideous
beast
which
reared
upwards
and
fell
with
all
its
weight
upon
its
adversary

terrible
combat
the
details
which
impossible
give
now
ensued
The
struggle
was
awful
and
ferocious
however
did
not
wait
witness
the
result
Regarding
myself
the
object
contention
determined
remove
from
the
presence
the
victor
slid
down
from
hiding
place
reached
the
ground
and
gliding
against
the
wall
strove
gain
the
open
mouth
the
cavern

But
had
not
taken
many
steps
when
the
fearful
clamor
ceased
followed
mumbling
and
groaning
which
appeared
indicative
victory

looked
back
and
saw
the
huge
ape
gory
with
blood
coming
after
with
glaring
eyes
with
dilated
nostrils
that
gave
forth
two
columns
heated
vapor
could
feel
his
hot
and
fetid
breath
neck
and
with
horrid
jump—awoke
from
nightmare
sleep

Yes—it
was
all
dream
was
still
the
raft
with
uncle
and
the
guide

The
relief
was
not
instantaneous
for
under
the
influence
the
hideous
nightmare
senses
had
become
numbed
After
while
however
feelings
were
tranquilized
The
first
perceptions
which
returned
full
force
was
that
hearing
listened
with
acute
and
attentive
ears
All
was
still
death
All
comprehended
was
silence
the
roaring
the
waters
which
had
filled
the
gallery
with
awful
reverberations
succeeded
perfect
peace

After
some
little
time
uncle
spoke
low
and
scarcely
audible
tone:
Harry
boy
where
are
you

here
was
faint
rejoinder

Well
don't
you
see
what
has
happened
are
going
upwards

dear
uncle
what
can
you
mean
was
half-delirious
reply

Yes

Our

quite

some
little
difficulty

This

effect

motion

certainly

the

therefore

rubbing

words

from
his
tone

Hans
shook

fully
appreciate
the
meaning
words
The
blow
seemed
stun
him
its
severity
allowed
him
reflect
for
some
moments

Well
said
after
short
pause
what
you
think
now
there
any
chance
our
escaping
from
our
horrible
subterranean
dangers
Are
not
doomed
perish
the
great
hollows
the
centre
the
earth

But
pertinent
questions
brought
answer
uncle
either
heard
not
appeared
not
And
this
way
whole
hour
passed
Neither
cared
speak
For
myself
began
feel
the
most
fearful
and
devouring
hunger
companions
doubtless
felt
the
same
horrible
tortures
but
neither
them
would
touch
the
wretched
morsel
meat
that
remained
lay
there
last
remnant
all
our
great
preparations
for
the
mad
and
senseless
journey

looked
back
with
wonderment
own
folly
Fully
was
aware
that
despite
his
enthusiasm
and
the
ever-to-be-hated
scroll
Saknussemm
uncle
should
never
have
started
his
perilous
voyage
What
memories
the
happy
past
what
previsions
the
horrible
future
now
filled
brain

CHAPTER
HUNGER

Hunger
prolonged
temporary
madness
The
brain
work
without
its
required
food
and
the
most
fantastic
notions
fill
the
mind
Hitherto
had
never
known
what
hunger
really
meant
was
likely
understand
now

And
yet
three
months
before
could
tell
terrible
story
starvation
thought
boy
used
make
frequent
excursions
the
neighborhood
the
Professor's
house

uncle
always
acted
system
and
believed
that
addition
the
day
rest
and
worship
there
should
day
recreation
consequence
was
always
free
liked
Wednesday

Now
had
notion
combine
the
useful
and
the
agreeable
favorite
pastime
was
birds'
nesting
had
one
the
best
collections
eggs
all
the
town
They
were
classified
and
under
glass
cases

There
was
certain
wood
which
rising
early
morn
and
taking
the
cheap
train
could
reach
eleven
the
morning
Here
would
botanize
geologize
will
uncle
was
always
glad
specimens
for
his
herbarium
and
stones
examine
When
had
filled
wallet
proceeded
search
for
nests

After
about
two
hours
hard
work
one
day
sat
down
stream
eat
humble
but
copious
lunch
How
the
remembrance
the
spiced
sausage
the
wheaten
loaf
and
the
beer
made
mouth
water
now
would
have
given
every
prospect
worldly
wealth
for
such
meal
But
story

While
seated
thus
leisure
looked
the
ruins
old
castle
great
distance
was
the
remains
historical
dwelling
ivy-clad
and
now
falling
pieces

While
looking
saw
two
eagles
circling
about
the
summit
lofty
tower
soon
became
satisfied
that
there
was
nest
Now
all
collection
lacked
eggs
the
native
eagle
and
the
large
owl

mind
was
made
would
reach
the
summit
that
tower
perish
the
attempt
went
nearer
and
surveyed
the
ruins
The
old
staircase
years
before
had
fallen
The
outer
walls
were
however
intact
There
was
chance
that
way
unless
looked
the
ivy
solely
for
support
This
was
soon
found
out
futile

There
remained
the
chimney
which
still
went
the
top
and
had
once
served
carry
off
the
smoke
from
every
story
the
tower

this
determined
venture
was
narrow
rough
and
therefore
the
more
easily
climbed
took
off
coat
and
crept
into
the
chimney
Looking
saw
small
light
opening
proclaiming
the
summit
the
chimney

Up—up
went
for
some
time
using
hands
and
knees
after
the
fashion
chimney
sweep
was
slow
work
but
there
being
continual
projections
the
task
was
comparatively
easy
this
way
reached
halfway
The
chimney
now
became
narrower
The
atmosphere
was
close
and
last
end
the
matter
stuck
fast
could
ascend
higher

There
could
doubt
this
and
there
remained
resource
but
descend
and
give
glorious
prey
despair
yielded
fate
and
endeavored
descend
But
could
not
move
Some
unseen
and
mysterious
obstacle
intervened
and
stopped
instant
the
full
horror
situation
seized
was
unable
move
either
way
and
was
doomed
terrible
and
horrible
death
that
starvation
boy's
mind
however
there
extraordinary
amount
elasticity
and
hope
and
began
think
all
sorts
plans
escape
gloomy
fate

the
first
place
required
food
just
present
having
had
excellent
meal
and
was
therefore
allowed
time
for
reflection
first
thought
was
try
and
move
the
mortar
with
hand
Had
possessed
knife
something
might
have
been
done
but
that
useful
instrument
had
left
coat
pocket

soon
found
that
all
efforts
this
kind
were
vain
and
useless
and
that
all
could
hope
was
wriggle
downwards

But
though
jerked
and
struggled
and
strove
turn
was
all
vain
could
not
move
inch
one
way
the
other
And
time
flew
rapidly
early
rising
probably
contributed
the
fact
that
felt
sleepy
and
gradually
gave
way
the
sensation
drowsiness

slept
and
awoke
darkness
ravenously
hungry

Night
had
come
and
still
could
not
move
was
tight
bound
and
did
not
succeed
changing
position
inch
groaned
aloud
Never
since
the
days
happy
childhood
when
was
hardship
from
meal
meal
without
eating
had
really
experienced
hunger
The
sensation
was
novel
was
painful
began
now
lose
head
and
scream
and
cry
out
agony
Something
appeared
startled
noise
was
harmless
lizard
but
appeared
loathsome
reptile
Again
made
the
old
ruins
resound
with
cries
and
finally
exhausted
myself
that
fainted

How
long
lay
kind
trance
sleep
cannot
say
but
when
again
recovered
consciousness
was
day
How
ill
felt
how
hunger
still
gnawed
would
hard
say
was
too
weak
scream
now
far
too
weak
struggle

Suddenly
was
startled
roar

Are
you
there
Henry
said
the
voice
uncle
are
you
there
boy

could
only
faintly
respond
but
also
made
desperate
effort
turn
Some
mortar
fell
this
owed
being
discovered
When
the
search
took
place
was
easily
seen
that
mortar
and
small
pieces
stone
had
recently
fallen
from
above
Hence
uncle's
cry

calm
cried
pull
down
the
whole
ruin
you
shall
saved

They
were
delicious
words
but
had
little
hope

Soon
however
about
quarter
hour
later
heard
voice
above
one
the
upper
fireplaces

Are
you
below
above

Below
was
reply

instant
basket
was
lowered
with
milk
biscuit
and
egg
uncle
was
fearful
too
ready
with
his
supply
food
drank
the
milk
first
for
thirst
had
nearly
deadened
hunger
then
much
refreshed
ate
bread
and
hard
egg

They
were
now
work
the
wall
could
hear
pickax
Wishing
escape
all
danger
from
this
terrible
weapon
made
desperate
struggle
and
the
belt
which
surrounded
waist
and
which
had
been
hitched
stone
gave
way
was
free
and
only
escaped
falling
down
rapid
motion
hands
and
knees

ten
minutes
more
was
uncle's
arms
after
being
two
days
and
nights
that
horrible
prison
occasional
delirium
prevented
from
counting
time

was
weeks
recovering
from
that
awful
starvation
adventure
and
yet
what
was
that
the
hideous
sufferings
now
endured

After
dreaming
for
some
time
and
thinking
this
and
other
matters
once
more
looked
around
were
still
ascending
with
fearful
rapidity
Every
now
and
then
the
air
appeared
check
our
respiration
does
that
aeronauts
when
the
ascension
the
balloon
too
rapid
But
they
feel
degree
cold
proportion
the
elevation
they
attain
the
atmosphere
experienced
quite
contrary
effect
The
heat
began
increase
most
threatening
and
exceptional
manner
cannot
tell
exactly
the
mean
but
think
must
have
reached
one
hundred
twenty-two
degrees
Fahrenheit

What
was
the
meaning
this
extraordinary
change
the
temperature
far
had
hitherto
gone
facts
had
proved
the
theories
Davy
and
Lidenbrock
correct
Until
now
all
the
peculiar
conditions
refractory
rocks
electricity
magnetism
had
modified
the
general
laws
nature
and
had
created
for
moderate
temperature
for
the
theory
the
central
fire
remained
eyes
the
only
explainable
one

Were
then
going
reach
position
which
these
phenomena
were
carried
out
all
their
rigor
and
which
the
heat
would
reduce
the
rocks
state
fusion

Such
was
not
unnatural
fear
and
did
not
conceal
the
fact
from
uncle
way
doing
might
cold
and
heartless
but
could
not
help
are
not
drowned
smashed
into
pancakes
and
not
die
starvation
have
the
satisfaction
knowing
that
must
burned
alive

uncle
presence
this
brusque
attack
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
resumed
his
reflections—whatever
they
might
hour
passed
away
and
except
that
there
was
slight
increase
the
temperature
incident
modified
the
situation

uncle
last
his
own
accord
broke
silence

Well
Henry
boy
said
cheerful
way
must
make
our
minds

Make
our
minds
what
asked
considerable
surprise

Well—to
something
must
whatever
risk
recruit
our
physical
strength
make
the
fatal
mistake
husbanding
our
little
remnant
food
may
probably
prolong
our
wretched
existence
few
hours—but
shall
remain
weak
the
end

Yes
growled
the
end
That
however
will
not
keep
long
waiting

Well
only
let
chance
safety
present
itself—only
allow
that
moment
action
necessary—where
shall
find
the
means
action
allow
ourselves
reduced
physical
weakness
inanition

When
this
piece
meat
devoured
Uncle
what
hope
will
there
remain
unto
None
dear
Henry
none
But
will
you
any
good
devour
with
your
eyes
You
appear
reason
like
one
without
will
decision
like
being
without
energy

Then
cried
exasperated
degree
which
scarcely
explained
you
not
mean
tell
me—that
you—that
you—have
not
lost
all
hope

Certainly
not
replied
the
Professor
with
consummate
coolness

You
mean
tell
Uncle
that
shall
get
out
this
monstrous
subterranean
shaft

While
there
life
there
hope
beg
assert
Henry
that
long
man's
heart
beats
long
man's
flesh
quivers
not
allow
that
being
gifted
with
thought
and
will
can
allow
himself
despair

What
nerve
The
man
placed
position
like
that
occupied
must
have
been
very
brave
speak
like
this

Well
cried
what
you
mean
Eat
what
remains
the
food
have
our
hands
let
swallow
the
last
crumb
will
bel
Heaven
willing
our
last
repast
Well
never
mind—instead
being
exhausted
skeletons
shall
men

True
muttered
despairing
tone
let
take
our
fill

must
replied
uncle
with
deep
sigh
call
what
you
will

uncle
took
piece
the
meat
that
remained
and
some
crusts
biscuit
which
had
escaped
the
wreck
divided
the
whole
into
three
parts

Each
had
one
pound
food
last
him
long
remained
the
interior
the
earth

Each
now
acted
accordance
with
his
own
private
character

uncle
the
Professor
ate
greedily
but
evidently
without
appetite
eating
simply
from
some
mechanical
motion
put
the
food
inside
lips
and
hungry
was
chewed
morsel
without
pleasure
and
without
satisfaction

Hans
the
guide
just
had
been
eider-down
hunting
swallowed
every
mouthful
though
were
usual
affair
looked
like
man
equally
prepared
enjoy
superfluity
total
want

Hans
all
probability
was
more
used
starvation
than
ourselves
but
his
hardy
Icelandic
nature
had
prepared
him
for
many
sufferings
long
received
his
three
rix-dollars
every
Saturday
night
was
prepared
for
anything

The
fact
was
Hans
never
troubled
himself
about
much
except
his
money
had
undertaken
serve
certain
man
much
per
week
and
matter
what
evils
befell
his
employer
himself
never
found
fault
grumbled
long
his
wages
were
duly
paid

Suddenly
uncle
roused
himself
had
seen
smile
the
face
our
guide
could
not
make
out

What
the
matter
said
uncle

Schiedam
said
the
guide
producing
bottle
this
precious
fluid

drank
uncle
and
myself
will
own
our
dying
day
that
hence
derived
strength
exist
until
the
last
bitter
moment
That
precious
bottle
Hollands
was
reality
only
half
full
but
under
the
circumstances
was
nectar

took
some
minutes
for
myself
and
uncle
form
decided
opinion
the
subject
The
worthy
Professor
swallowed
about
half
pint
and
did
not
seem
able
drink
any
more

Fortrafflig
said
Hans
swallowing
nearly
all
that
was
left

Excellent—very
good
said
uncle
with
much
gusto
had
just
left
the
steps
the
club
Hamburg

had
begun
feel
there
had
been
one
gleam
hope
Now
all
thought
the
future
vanished

had
consumed
our
last
ounce
food
and
was
five
o'clock
the
morning

CHAPTER
THE
VOLCANIC
SHAFT

Man's
constitution
peculiar
that
his
health
purely
negative
matter
sooner
the
rage
hunger
appeased
than
becomes
difficult
comprehend
the
meaning
starvation
only
when
you
suffer
that
you
really
understand

anyone
who
has
not
endured
privation
having
any
notion
the
matter
simply
absurd

With
after
long
fast
some
mouthfuls
bread
and
meat
little
moldy
biscuit
and
salt
beef
triumphed
over
all
our
previous
gloomy
and
saturnine
thoughts

Nevertheless
after
this
repast
each
gave
way
his
own
reflections
wondered
what
were
those
Hans—the
man
the
extreme
north
who
was
yet
gifted
with
the
fatalistic
resignation
Oriental
character
But
the
utmost
stretch
the
imagination
would
not
allow
realize
the
truth
for
individual
self
thoughts
had
ceased
anything
but
memories
the
past
and
were
all
connected
with
that
upper
world
which
never
should
have
left
saw
all
now
the
beautiful
house
the
Konigstrasse
poor
Gretchen
the
good
Martha
they
all
passed
before
mind
like
visions
the
past
Every
time
any
the
lugubrious
groanings
which
were
distinguished
the
hollows
around
fell
upon
ears
fancied
heard
the
distant
murmur
the
great
cities
above
head

for
uncle
always
thinking
his
science
examined
the
nature
the
shaft
means
torch
closely
examined
the
different
strata
one
above
the
other
order
recognize
his
situation
geological
theory
This
calculation
rather
this
estimation
could
means
anything
but
approximate
But
learned
man
philosopher
nothing
not
philosopher
when
keeps
his
ideas
calm
and
collected
and
certainly
the
Professor
possessed
this
quality
perfection

heard
him
sat
silence
murmuring
words
geological
science
understood
his
object
and
his
meaning
could
not
but
interest
myself
despite
preoccupation
that
terrible
hour

Eruptive
granite
said
himself
are
still
the
primitive
epoch
But
are
going
up—going
still
going
But
who
knows
Who
knows

Then
still
hoped
felt
along
the
vertical
sides
the
shaft
with
his
hand
and
some
few
minutes
later
would
again
the
following
style:

This
gneiss
This
mica
schist—siliceous
mineral
Good
again
this
the
epoch
transition
all
events
are
close
them—and
then
and
then—

What
could
the
Professor
mean
Could
any
conceivable
means
measure
the
thickness
the
crust
the
earth
suspended
above
our
heads
Did
possess
any
possible
means
making
any
approximation
this
calculation
The
manometer
was
wanting
and
summary
estimation
could
take
the
place
And
yet
progressed
the
temperature
increased
the
most
extraordinary
degree
and
began
feel
were
bathed
hot
and
burning
atmosphere
Never
before
had
felt
anything
like
could
only
compare
the
hot
vapor
from
iron
foundry
when
the
liquid
iron
state
ebullition
and
runs
over
degrees
and
one
after
the
other
Hans
uncle
and
myself
had
taken
off
our
coats
and
waistcoats
They
were
unbearable
Even
the
slightest
garment
was
not
only
uncomfortable
but
the
cause
extreme
suffering

Are
ascending
living
fire
cried
when
horror
and
astonishment
the
heat
became
greater
than
before

said
uncle
simply
impossible
quite
impossible

And
yet
said
touching
the
side
the
shaft
with
naked
hand
this
wall
literally
burning

this
moment
feeling
did
that
the
sides
this
extraordinary
wall
were
red
hot
plunged
hands
into
the
water
cool
them
drew
them
back
with
cry
despair

The
water
boiling
cried

uncle
the
Professor
made
reply
other
than
gesture
rage
and
despair

Something
very
like
the
truth
had
probably
struck
his
imagination

But
could
take
share
either
what
was
going
his
speculations
invincible
dread
had
taken
possession
brain
and
soul
could
only
look
forward
immediate
catastrophe
such
catastrophe
not
even
the
most
vivid
imagination
could
have
thought
idea
first
vague
and
uncertain
was
gradually
being
changed
into
certainty

tremulously
rejected
first
but
forced
itself
upon
degrees
with
extreme
obstinacy
was
terrible
idea
that
scarcely
dared
whisper
myself

And
yet
all
the
while
certain
and
were
involuntary
observations
determined
convictions
the
doubtful
glare
the
torch
could
make
out
some
singular
changes
the
granitic
strata
strange
and
terrible
phenomenon
was
about
produced
which
electricity
played
part

Then
this
boiling
water
this
terrible
and
excessive
heat
determined
last
resource
examine
the
compass

The
compass
had
gone
mad

Yes
wholly
stark
staring
mad
The
needle
jumped
from
pole
pole
with
sudden
and
surprising
jerks
ran
round
said
boxed
the
compass
and
then
ran
suddenly
back
again
had
the
vertigo

was
aware
that
according
the
best
acknowledged
theories
was
received
notion
that
the
mineral
crust
the
globe
never
and
never
has
been
state
complete
repose

perpetually
undergoing
the
modifications
caused
the
decomposition
internal
matter
the
agitation
consequent
the
flowing
extensive
liquid
currents
the
excessive
action
magnetism
which
tends
shake
incessantly
time
when
even
the
multitudinous
beings
its
surface
not
suspect
the
seething
process
going
Still
this
phenomenon
would
not
have
alarmed
alone
would
not
have
aroused
mind
terrible
awful
idea

But
other
facts
could
not
allow
self-delusion
last

Terrible
detonations
like
Heaven's
artillery
began
multiply
themselves
with
fearful
intensity
could
only
compare
them
with
the
noise
made
hundreds
heavily
laden
chariots
being
madly
driven
over
stone
pavement
was
continuous
roll
heavy
thunder

And
then
the
mad
compass
shaken
the
wild
electric
phenomena
confirmed
rapidly
formed
opinion
The
mineral

the

What

the

and

that

The
most

Had
uncle
really
and
truly
gone

What
did

What

and
you
say—the
most
fortunate
thing
which
could

Yes
replied
the
Professor
looking
calmly
from
under
his
spectacles
the
only
chance
which
remains
ever
escaping
from
the
interior
the
earth
the
light
day

quite
impossible
that
can
put
paper
the
thousand
strange
wild
thoughts
which
followed
this
extraordinary
announcement

But
uncle
was
right
quite
right
and
never
had
appeared
audacious
and
convinced
when
looked
calmly
the
face
and
spoke
the
chances
eruption—of
our
being
cast
upon
Mother
Earth
once
more
through
the
gaping
crater
volcano

Nevertheless
while
were
speaking
were
still
ascending
passed
the
whole
night
going
speak
more
scientifically
ascensional
motion
The
fearful
noise
redoubled
was
ready
suffocate
seriously
believed
that
last
hour
was
approaching
and
yet
strange
imagination
all
thought
was
some
childish
hypothesis
other
such
circumstances
you
not
choose
your
own
thoughts
They
overcome
you

was
quite
evident
that
were
being
cast
upwards
eruptive
matter
under
the
raft
there
was
mass
boiling
water
and
under
this
was
heavier
mass
lava
and
aggregate
rocks
which
reaching
the
summit
the
water
would
dispersed
every
direction

That
were
inside
the
chimney
volcano
there
could
longer
the
shadow
doubt
Nothing
more
terrible
could
conceived

But
this
occasion
instead
Sneffels
old
and
extinct
volcano
were
inside
mountain
fire
full
activity
Several
times
found
myself
asking
what
mountain
was
and
what
part
the
world
should
shot
out
were
any
consequence

the
northern
regions
there
could
reasonable
doubt
about
that
Before
went
decidedly
mad
the
compass
had
never
made
the
slightest
mistake
From
the
cape
Saknussemm
had
been
swept
away
the
northward
many
hundreds
leagues
Now
the
question
was
were
once
more
under
Iceland—should
belched
forth
the
earth
through
the
crater
Mount
Hecla
should
reappear
through
one
the
other
seven
fire
funnels
the
island
Taking
mental
vision
radius
five
hundred
leagues
the
westward
could
see
under
this
parallel
only
the
little-known
volcanoes
the
northwest
coast
America

the
east
one
only
existed
somewhere
about
the
eightieth
degree
latitude
the
Esk
upon
the
island
Jan
Mayen
not
far
from
the
frozen
regions
Spitsbergen

was
not
craters
that
were
wanting
and
many
them
were
big
enough
vomit
whole
army
all
wished
know
was
the
particular
one
towards
which
were
making
with
such
fearful
velocity

often
think
now
folly:
should
ever
have
expected
escape

Towards
morning
the
ascending
motion
became
greater
and
greater
the
degree
heat
increased
instead
decreasing
approached
the
surface
the
earth
was
simply
because
the
causes
were
local
and
wholly
due
volcanic
influence
Our
very
style
locomotion
left
mind
doubt
upon
the
subject
enormous
force
force
several
hundreds
atmospheres
produced
the
vapors
accumulated
and
long
compressed
the
interior
the
earth
was
hoisting
upwards
with
irresistible
power

But
though
were
approaching
the
light
day
what
fearful
dangers
were
about
exposed

Instant
death
appeared
the
only
fate
which
could
expect
contemplate

Soon
dim
sepulchral
light
penetrated
the
vertical
gallery
which
became
wider
and
wider
could
make
out
the
right
and
left
long
dark
corridors
like
immense
tunnels
from
which
awful
and
horrid
vapors
poured
out
Tongues
fire
sparkling
and
crackling
appeared
about
lick
The
hour
had
come

Look
Uncle
look
cried

Well
what
you
see
are
the
great
sulphurous
flames
Nothing
more
common
connection
with
eruption

But
they
lap
round
angrily
replied

They
will
not
lap
round
was
his
quiet
and
serene
answer

But
will
all
the
same
the
end
they
stifle
cried

shall
not
stifled
The
gallery
rapidly
becoming
wider
and
wider
and
necessary
will
presently
leave
the
raft
and
take
refuge
some
fissure
the
rock

But
the
water
the
water
which
continually
ascending
despairingly
replied

There
longer
any
water
Harry
answered
but
kind
lava
paste
which
heaving
company
with
itself
the
mouth
the
crater

truth
the
liquid
column
water
had
wholly
disappeared
give
place
dense
masses
boiling
eruptive
matter
The
temperature
was
becoming
utterly
insupportable
and
thermometer
exposed
this
atmosphere
would
have
marked
between
one
hundred
and
eighty-nine
and
one
hundred
ninety
degrees
Fahrenheit

Perspiration
rushed
from
every
pore
But
for
the
extraordinary
rapidity
our
ascent
should
have
been
stifled

Nevertheless
the
Professor
did
not
carry
out
his
proposition
abandoning
the
raft
and
did
quite
wisely
Those
few
ill-joined
beams
offered
anyway
solid
surface—a
support
which
elsewhere
must
have
utterly
failed
Towards
eight
o'clock
the
morning
new
incident
startled
The
ascensional
movement
suddenly
ceased
The
raft
became
still
and
motionless

What
the
matter
now
said
querulously
very
much
startled
this
change

simple
halt
replied
uncle

the
eruption
about
fail
asked

hope
not

Without
making
any
reply
rose
tried
look
around
Perhaps
the
raft
checked
some
projecting
rock
opposed
momentary
resistance
the
eruptive
mass
this
case
was
absolutely
necessary
release
quickly
possible

Nothing
the
kind
had
occurred
The
column
cinders
scoriae
broken
rocks
and
earth
had
wholly
ceased
ascend

tell
you
Uncle
that
the
eruption
has
stopped
was
oracular
decision

said
uncle
you
think
boy
You
are
wrong
not
the
least
alarmed
this
sudden
moment
calm
will
not
last
long
assured
has
already
endured
five
minutes
and
before
are
many
minutes
older
shall
continuing
our
journey
the
mouth
the
crater

All
the
time
was
speaking
the
Professor
continued
consult
his
chronometer
and
was
probably
right
his
prognostics
Soon
the
raft
resumed
its
motion
very
rapid
and
disorderly
way
which
lasted
two
minutes
thereabout
and
then
again
stopped
suddenly
before

Good
said
uncle
observing
the
hour
ten

start
again

ten
minutes

Yes—precisely
have
with

the
eruption
which
intermittent
are
compelled

Nothing
could

exact
minute
had
indicated

again
launched
high
with
extreme
rapidity
Not
cast
off
the
raft
was
necessary
hold
the
beams
Then
the
hoist
again
ceased

Many
times
since
have
thought
this
singular
phenomenon
without
being
able
find
for
any
satisfactory
explanation
Nevertheless
appeared
quite
clear
that
were
not
the
principal
chimney
the
volcano
but
accessory
conduit
where
felt
the
counter
shock
the
great
and
principal
tunnel
filled
burning
lava

impossible
for
say
how
many
times
this
maneuver
was
repeated
All
that
can
remember
that
every
ascensional
motion
were
hoisted
with
ever
increasing
velocity
had
been
launched
from
huge
projectile
During
the
sudden
halts
were
nearly
stifled
during
the
moments

the
hot
air
took
away
our
breath

for

voluptuous
joy

Had

that
sinister
dread
which

CHAPTER
DAYLIGHT
LAST

When
opened
eyes
felt
the
hand
the
guide
clutching
firmly
the
belt
With
his
other
hand
supported
uncle
was
not
grievously
wounded
but
bruised
all
over
the
most
remarkable
manner

After
moment
looked
around
and
found
that
was
lying
down
the
slope
mountain
not
two
yards
from
yawning
gulf
into
which
should
have
fallen
had
made
the
slightest
false
step
Hans
had
saved
from
death
while
rolled
insensible
the
flanks
the
crater

Where
are
dreamily
asked
uncle
who
literally
appeared
disgusted
having
returned
earth

The
eider-down
hunter
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
mark
total
ignorance

Iceland
said
not
positively
but
interrogatively

Nej
said
Hans

How
you
mean
cried
the
Professor
no—what
are
your
reasons

Hans
wrong
said
rising

After
all
the
innumerable
surprises
this
journey
yet
more
singular
one
was
reserved
expected
see
cone
covered
snow
extensive
and
widespread
glaciers
the
midst
the
arid
deserts
the
extreme
northern
regions
beneath
the
full
rays
polar
sky
beyond
the
highest
latitudes

But
contrary
all
our
expectations
uncle
and
the
Icelander
were
cast
upon
the
slope
mountain
calcined
the
burning
rays
sun
which
was
literally
baking
with
its
fires

could
not
believe
eyes
but
the
actual
heat
which
affected
body
allowed
chance
doubting
came
out
the
crater
half
naked
and
the
radiant
star
from
which
had
asked
nothing
for
two
months
was
good
enough
prodigal
light
and
warmth—a
light
and
warmth
could
easily
have
dispensed
with

When
our
eyes
were
accustomed
the
light
had
lost
sight
long
used
them
rectify
the
errors
imagination
Whatever
happened
should
have
been
Spitsbergen
and
was
humor
yield
anything
but
the
most
absolute
proof

After
some
delay
the
Professor
spoke

Hem
said
hesitating
kind
way
really
does
not
look
like
Iceland

But
supposing
were
the
island
Jan
Mayen
ventured
observe

Not
the
least
boy
This
not
one
the
volcanoes
the
north
with
its
hills
granite
and
its
crown
snow

Nevertheless—

Look
look
boy
said
the
Professor
dogmatically
usual

Right
above
our
heads
great
height
opened
the
crater
volcano
from
which
escaped
from
one
quarter
hour
the
other
with
very
loud
explosion
lofty
jet
flame
mingled
with
pumice
stone
cinders
and
lava
could
feel
the
convulsions
nature
the
mountain
which
breathed
like
huge
whale
throwing
from
time
time
fire
and
air
through
its
enormous
vents

Below
and
floating
along
slope
considerable
angularity
the
stream
eruptive
matter
spread
away
depth
which
did
not
give
the
volcano
height
three
hundred
fathoms

Its
base
disappeared
perfect
forest
green
trees
among
which
perceived
olives
fig
trees
and
vines
loaded
with
rich
grapes

Certainly
this
was
not
the
ordinary
aspect
the
arctic
regions
About
that
there
could
not
the
slightest
doubt

When
the
eye
was
satisfied
its
glimpse
this
verdant
expanse
fell
upon
the
waters
lovely
sea
beautiful
lake
which
made
this
enchanted
land
island
not
many
leagues
extent

the
side
the
rising
sun
was
seen
little
port
crowded
with
houses
and
near
which
the
boats
and
vessels
peculiar
build
were
floating
upon
azure
waves

Beyond
groups
islands
rose
above
the
liquid
plain
numerous
and
close
together
resemble
vast
beehive

Towards
the
setting
sun
some
distant
shores
were
made
out
the
edge
the
horizon
Some
presented
the
appearance
blue
mountains
harmonious
conformation
upon
others
much
more
distant
there
appeared
prodigiously
lofty
cone
above
the
summit
which
hung
dark
and
heavy
clouds

Towards
the
north
immense
expanse
water
sparkled
beneath
the
solar
rays
occasionally
allowing
the
extremity
mast
the
convexity
sail
bellying
the
wind
seen

The
unexpected
character
such
scene
added
hundredfold
its
marvelous
beauties

Where
can
asked
speaking
low
and
solemn
voice

Hans
shut
his
eyes
with
air
indifference
and
uncle
looked
without
clearly
understanding

Whatever
this
mountain
may
said
last
must
confess
rather
warm
The
explosions
not
leave
off
and
not
think
worthwhile
have
left
the
interior
volcano
and
remain
here
receive
huge
piece
rock
upon
one's
head
Let
carefully
descend
the
mountain
and
discover
the
real
state
the
case
confess
the
truth
dying
hunger
and
thirst

Decidedly
the
Professor
was
longer
truly
reflective
character
For
myself
forgetting
all
necessities
ignoring
fatigues
and
sufferings
should
have
remained
still
for
several
hours
longer—but
was
necessary
follow
companions

The
slope
the
volcano
was
very
steep
and
slippery
slid
over
piles
ashes
avoiding
the
streams
hot
lava
which
glided
about
like
fiery
serpents
Still
while
were
advancing
spoke
with
extreme
volubility
for
imagination
was
too
full
not
explode
words

are
Asia
exclaimed
are
the
coast
India
the
great
Malay
islands
the
centre
Oceania
have
crossed
the
one
half
the
globe
come
out
right
the
antipodes
Europe

But
the
compass
exclaimed
uncle
explain
that
Yes—the
compass
said
with
considerable
hesitation
grant
that
difficulty
According
have
always
been
going
northward

Then
lied

Hem—to
say
lied
rather
harsh
word
was
answer

Then
are
the
North
Pole—

The
Pole—no—well—well
give
was
reply

The
plain
truth
was
that
there
was
explanation
possible
could
make
nothing
And
all
the
while
were
approaching
this
beautiful
verdure
hunger
and
thirst
tormented
fearfully
Happily
after
two
long
hours'
march
beautiful
country
spread
out
before
covered
olives
pomegranates
and
vines
which
appeared
belong
anybody
and
everybody
any
event
the
state
destitution
into
which
had
fallen
were
not
mood
ponder
too
scrupulously

What
delight
was
press
these
delicious
fruits
our
lips
and
bite
grapes
and
pomegranates
fresh
from
the
vine

Not
far
off
near
some
fresh
and
mossy
grass
under
the
delicious
shade
some
trees
discovered
spring
fresh
water
which
voluptuously
laved
our
faces
hands
and
feet

While
were
all
giving
way
the
delights
new-found
pleasures
little
child
appeared
between
two
tufted
olive
trees

cried
inhabitant
this
happy
country

The
little
fellow
was
poorly
dressed
weak
and
suffering
and
appeared
terribly
alarmed
our
appearance
Half-naked
with
tangled
matted
and
ragged
beards
did
look
supremely
ill-favored
and
unless
the
country
was
bandit
land
were
not
likely
alarm
the
inhabitants

Just
the
boy
was
about
take
his
heels
Hans
ran
after
him
and
brought
him
back
despite
his
cries
and
kicks

uncle
tried
look
gentle
possible
and
then
spoke
German

What
the
name
this
mountain
friend

The
child
made
reply

Good
said
uncle
with
very
positive
air
conviction
are
not
Germany

then
made
the
same
demand
English
which
language
was
excellent
scholar

The
child
shook
its
head
and
made
reply
began
considerably
puzzled

dumb
cried
the
Professor
who
was
rather
proud
his
polyglot
knowledge
languages
and
made
the
same
demand
French

The
boy
only
stared
his
face

must
perforce
try
him
Italian
said
uncle
with
shrug

Dove
noi
siamo

Yes
tell
where
are
added
impatiently
and
eagerly

Again
the
boy
remained
silent

fine
fellow
you
you
not
mean
speak
cried
uncle
who
began
get
angry
shook
him
and
spoke
another
dialect
the
Italian
language

Come
noma
questa
isola—What
the
name
this
island

Stromboli
replied
the
rickety
little
shepherd
dashing
away
from
Hans
and
disappearing
the
olive
groves

thought
little
enough
about
him

Stromboli
What
effect
the
imagination
did
these
few
words
produce
were
the
centre
the
Mediterranean
amidst
the
eastern
archipelago
mythological
memory
the
ancient
Strongylos
where
AEolus
kept
the
wind
and
the
tempest
chained
And
those
blue
mountains
which
rose
towards
the
rising
sun
were
the
mountains
Calabria

And
that
mighty
volcano
which
rose
the
southern
horizon
was
Etna
the
fierce
and
celebrated
Etna

Stromboli
Stromboli
repeated
myself

uncle
played
regular
accompaniment
gestures
and
words
were
singing
together
like
ancient
chorus

Ah—what
journey—what
marvelous
and
extraordinary
journey
Here
had
entered
the
earth
one
volcano
and
had
come
out
another
And
this
other
was
situated
more
than
twelve
hundred
leagues
from
Sneffels
from
that
drear
country
Iceland
cast
away
the
confines
the
earth
The
wondrous
changes
this
expedition
had
transported
the
most
harmonious
and
beautiful
earthly
lands
had
abandoned
the
region
eternal
snows
for
that
infinite
verdure
and
had
left
over
our
heads
the
gray
fog
the
icy
regions
come
back
the
azure
sky
Sicily

After
delicious
repast
fruits
and
fresh
water
again
continued
our
journey
order
reach
the
port
Stromboli
say
how
had
reached
the
island
would
scarcely
have
been
prudent
The
superstitious
character
the
Italians
would
have
been
work
and
should
have
been
called
demons
vomited
from
the
infernal
regions
was
therefore
necessary
pass
for
humble
and
unfortunate
shipwrecked
travelers
was
certainly
less
striking
and
romantic
but
was
decidedly
safer

advanced
could
hear
worthy
uncle
muttering
himself:

But
the
compass
The
compass
most
certainly
marked
north
This
fact
cannot
explain
any
way

Well
the
fact
said
with
air
disdain
must
not
explain
anything
will
much
more
easy

should
like
see
professor
the
Johanneum
Institution
who
unable
explain
cosmic
phenomenon—it
would
indeed
strange

And
speaking
thus
uncle
half-naked
his
leathern
purse
round
his
loins
and
his
spectacles
upon
his
nose
became
once
more
the
terrible
Professor
Mineralogy

hour
after
leaving
the
wood
olives
reached
the
fort
San
Vicenza
where
Hans
demanded
the
price
his
thirteenth
week
service
uncle
paid
him
with
very
many
warm
shakes
the
hand

that
moment
did
not
indeed
quite
share
our
natural
emotion
allowed
his
feelings
far
give
way
indulge
extraordinary
expression
for
him

With
the
tips
two
fingers
gently
pressed
our
hands
and
smiled

CHAPTER
THE
JOURNEY
ENDED

This
the
final
conclusion
narrative
which
will
probably
disbelieved
even
people
who
are
astonished
nothing
however
armed
all
points
against
human
incredulity

were
kindly
received
the
Strombolite
fishermen
who
treated
shipwrecked
travelers
They
gave
clothes
and
food
After
delay
forty-eight
hours
the
September
little
vessel
took
Messina
where
few
days
delightful
and
complete
repose
restored
ourselves

Friday
the
October
embarked
the
Volturne
one
the
postal
packets
the
Imperial
Messageries
France
and
three
days
later
landed
Marseilles
having
other
care
our
minds
but
that
our
precious
but
erratic
compass
This
inexplicable
circumstance
tormented
terribly
the
October
the
evening
reached
Hamburg

What
was
the
astonishment
Martha
what
the
joy
Gretchen
will
not
attempt
define
Now
then
Harry
that
you
really
are
hero
she
said
there
reason
why
you
should
ever
leave
again

looked
her
She
was
weeping
tears
joy

leave
imagined
the
return
Professor
Hardwigg
made
did
not
make
sensation
Hamburg
Thanks
the
indiscretion
Martha
the
news
his
departure
for
the
interior
the
earth
had
been
spread
over
the
whole
world

one
would
believe
it—and
when
they
saw
him
come
back
safety
they
believed
all
the
less

But
the
presence
Hans
and
many
stray
scraps
information
degrees
modified
public
opinion

Then
uncle
became
great
man
and
the
nephew
great
man
which
all
events
something
Hamburg
gave
festival
our
honor
public
meeting
the
Johanneum
Institution
was
held
which
the
Professor
related
the
whole
story
his
adventures
omitting
only
the
facts
connection
with
the
compass

That
same
day
deposited
the
archives
the
town
the
document
had
found
written
Saknussemm
and
expressed
his
great
regret
that
circumstances
stronger
than
his
will
did
not
allow
him
follow
the
Icelandic
traveler's
track
into
the
very
centre
the
earth
was
modest
his
glory
but
his
reputation
only
increased

much
honor
necessarily
created
for
him
many
envious
enemies
course
they
existed
and
his
theories
supported
certain
facts
contradicted
the
system
science
upon
the
question
central
heat
maintained
his
own
views
both
with
pen
and
speech
against
the
learned
every
country
Although
still
believe
the
theory
central
heat
confess
that
certain
circumstances
hitherto
very
ill
defined
may
modify
the
laws
such
natural
phenomena

the
moment
when
these
questions
were
being
discussed
with
interest
uncle
received
rude
shock—one
that
felt
very
much
Hans
despite
everything
could
say
the
contrary
quitted
Hamburg
the
man
whom
owed
much
would
not
allow
pay
our
deep
debt
gratitude
was
taken
with
nostalgia
love
for
his
Icelandic
home

Farval
said
one
day
and
with
this
one
short
word
adieu
started
for
Reykjavik
which
soon
reached
safety

were
deeply
attached
our
brave
eider-duck
hunter
His
absence
will
never
cause
him
forgotten
those
whose
lives
saved
and
hope
some
not
distant
day
see
him
again

conclude
may
say
that
our
journey
into
the
interior
the
earth
created
enormous
sensation
throughout
the
civilized
world
was
translated
and
printed
many
languages
All
the
leading
journals
published
extracts
from
which
were
commentated
discussed
attacked
and
supported
with
equal
animation
those
who
believed
its
episodes
and
those
who
were
utterly
incredulous

Wonderful
uncle
enjoyed
during
his
lifetime
all
the
glory
deserved
and
was
even
offered
large
sum
money
Barnum
exhibit
himself
the
United
States
while
credibly
informed
traveler
that
seen
waxwork
Madame
Tussaud's

But
one
care
preyed
upon
his
mind
care
which
rendered
him
very
unhappy
One
fact
remained
inexplicable—that
the
compass
For
learned
man
baffled
such
inexplicable
phenomenon
was
very
aggravating
But
Heaven
was
merciful
and
the
end
uncle
was
happy

One
day
while
put
some
minerals
belonging
his
collection
order
fell
upon
the
famous
compass
and
examined
keenly

For
six
months
had
lain
unnoticed
and
untouched

looked
with
curiosity
which
soon
became
surprise
gave
loud
cry
The
Professor
who
was
hand
soon
joined
What
the
matter
cried

The
compass

What
then

Why
its
needle
points
the
south
and
not
the
north

dear
boy
you
must
dreaming

not
dreaming
See—the
poles
are
changed

Changed

uncle
put
his
spectacles
examined
the
instrument
and
leaped
with
joy
shaking
the
whole
house

clear
light
fell
upon
our
minds

Here
cried
soon
had
recovered
the
use
his
speech
after
had
once
passed
Cape
Saknussemm
the
needle
this
compass
pointed
the
southward
instead
the
northward

Evidently

Our
error
now
easily
explained
But
what
phenomenon
owe
this
alteration
the
needle

Nothing
more
simple

Explain
yourself
boy
thorns

During
the
storm
upon
the
Central
Sea
the
ball
fire
which
made
magnet
the
iron
our
raft
turned
our
compass
topsy-turvy

cried
the
Professor
with
loud
and
ringing
laugh
was
trick
that
inexplicable
electricity

From
that
hour
uncle
was
the
happiest
learned
men
and
the
happiest
ordinary
mortals
For
pretty
Virland
girl
abdicating
her
position
ward
took
her
place
the
house
the
Konigstrasse
the
double
quality
niece
and
wife

need
scarcely
mention
that
her
uncle
was
the
illustrious
Professor
Hardwigg
corresponding
member
all
the
scientific
geographical
mineralogical
and
geological
societies
